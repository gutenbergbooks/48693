<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>This volume makes no pretence whatever of being
either an exhaustive or a scientific study of the subject to
which it relates. It is, on the contrary, merely what its
title signifies,&mdash;a collection of notes on railroad accidents.
In the course of ten years service as one of the railroad
commissioners of Massachusetts, I was called upon officially
to investigate two very serious disasters,&mdash;that at Revere
in 1871, and that at Wollaston in 1878,&mdash;besides many
others less memorable. In connection with these official
duties I got together by degrees a considerable body of
information, which I was obliged to extract as best I
could from newspapers and other contemporaneous
sources. I have felt the utmost hesitation in publishing
so crude and imperfect a performance, but finally decide
to do so for the reason that, so far as I know, there is
nothing relating to this subject in print in an accessible
form, and it would, therefore, seem that these notes may
have a temporary value.</p>

<p>During my term of public service, also, there have been
four appliances, either introduced into use or now struggling
for American recognition, my sense of the value of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
which, in connection with the railroad system, to both
the traveling and general public, I could not easily overstate.
These appliances are the <span class="smcap">Miller Platform</span> and
<span class="smcap">Buffer</span>, the <span class="smcap">Westinghouse Brake</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Interlocking</span>
and <span class="smcap">Electric Signal Systems</span>. To bring
these into more general use through reports on railroad
accidents as they occurred was one great aim with me
throughout my official life. I am now not without hopes
that the printing of this volume may tend to still further
familiarize the public with these inventions, and thus
hasten their more general adoption.</p>

RAILROAD ACCIDENTS.</p>


<p>It is a melancholy fact that there are few things
of which either nature or man is, as a rule, more
lavish than human life;&mdash;provided always that the
methods used in extinguishing it are customary and
not unduly obtrusive on the sight and nerves. As
a necessary consequence of this wastefulness, it follows
also that the results which ordinarily flow
from the extinguishment of the individual life are
pitiably small. Any person curious to satisfy himself
as to the truth of either or both of these propositions
can do so easily enough by visiting those
frequent haunts in which poverty and typhoid lurk
in company; or yet more easily by a careful study
of the weekly bills of mortality of any great city.
Indeed, compared with the massive battalions daily
sacrificed in the perpetual conflict which mankind
seems forever doomed to wage against intemperance,
bad sewerage and worse ventilation, the victims of
regular warfare by sea and land count as but single
spies. The worst of it is, too, that if the blood of the
martyrs thus profusely spilled is at all the seed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the church, it is a seed terribly slow of germination.
Each step in the slow progress is a Golgotha.</p>

<p>In the case of railroad disasters, however, a striking
exception is afforded to this rule. The victims of
these, at least, do not lose their lives without great
and immediate compensating benefits to mankind.
After each new "horror," as it is called, the whole
world travels with an appreciable increase of safety.
Both by public opinion and the courts of law the
companies are held to a most rigid responsibility.
The causes which led to the disaster are anxiously
investigated by ingenious men, new appliances are
invented, new precautions are imposed, a greater
and more watchful care is inculcated. And hence
it has resulted that each year, and in obvious consequence
of each fresh catastrophe, travel by rail has
become safer and safer, until it has been said, and
with no inconsiderable degree of truth too, that the
very safest place into which a man can put himself
is the inside of a first-class railroad carriage on a
train in full motion.</p>

<p>The study of railroad accidents is, therefore, the
furthest possible from being a useless one, and a
record of them is hardly less instructive than interesting.
If carried too far it is apt, as matter for
light reading, to become somewhat monotonous;
though, none the less, about these, as about everything
else, there is an almost endless variety. Even in
the forms of sudden death on the rail, nature seems
to take a grim delight in an infinitude of surprises.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>THE DEATH OF MR. HUSKISSON.</h3>


<p>With a true dramatic propriety, the ghastly
record, which has since grown so long, began with
the opening of the first railroad,&mdash;literally on the
very morning which finally ushered the great
system into existence as a successfully accomplished
fact, the eventful 15th of September, 1830,&mdash;the
day upon which the Manchester &amp; Liverpool
railroad was formally opened. That opening was
a great affair. A brilliant party, consisting of the
directors of the new enterprise and their invited
guests, was to pass over the road from Liverpool
to Manchester, dine at the latter place and return
to Liverpool in the afternoon. Their number
was large and they filled eight trains of carriages,
drawn by as many locomotives. The Duke
of Wellington, then prime minister, was the most
prominent personage there, and he with his party
occupied the state car, which was drawn by the locomotive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
<i>Northumbrian</i>, upon which George Stephenson
himself that day officiated as engineer.
The road was laid with double tracks, and the eight
trains proceeded in two parallel columns, running
side by side and then again passing or falling
behind each other. The Duke's train gaily led the
race, while in a car of one of the succeeding trains
was Mr. William Huskisson, then a member of Parliament
for Liverpool and eminent among the more
prominent public men of the day as a financier and
economist. He had been very active in promoting
the construction of the Manchester &amp; Liverpool
road, and now that it was completed he had exerted
himself greatly to make its opening a success
worthy an enterprise the far-reaching consequences
of which he was among the few to appreciate. All
the trains had started promptly from Liverpool, and
had proceeded through a continued ovation until at
eleven o'clock they had reached Parkside, seventeen
miles upon their journey, where it had been arranged
that the locomotives were to replenish their supplies
of water. As soon as the trains had stopped,
disregarding every caution against their so doing,
the excited and joyous passengers left their carriages
and mingled together, eagerly congratulating
one another upon the unalloyed success of the occasion.
Mr. Huskisson, though in poor health and
somewhat lame, was one of the most excited of the
throng, and among the first to thus expose himself.
Presently he caught the eye of the Duke of Wellington,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
standing at the door of his carriage. Now it so
happened that for some time previous a coolness had
existed between the two public men, the Duke having
as premier, with the military curtness for which
he was famed, dismissed Mr. Huskisson from the
cabinet of which he had been a member, without, as
was generally considered, any sufficient cause, and
in much the same way that he might have sent to
the right-about some member of his staff whose
performance of his duty was not satisfactory to him.
There had in fact been a most noticeable absence
of courtesy in that ministerial crisis. The two now
met face to face for the first time since the breach
between them had taken place, and the Duke's manner
evinced a disposition to be conciliatory, which
was by no means usual with that austere soldier.
Mr. Huskisson at once responded to the overture,
and, going up to the door of the state carriage, he
and his former chief shook hands and then entered
into conversation. As they were talking, the Duke
seated in his car and Mr. Huskisson standing between
the tracks, the <i>Rocket</i> locomotive&mdash;the same
famous <i>Rocket</i> which a year previous had won the
five hundred pounds prize, and by so doing established
forever the feasibility of rapid steam locomotion&mdash;came
along upon the other track to take its
place at the watering station. It came up slowly
and so silently that its approach was hardly noticed;
until, suddenly, an alarm was given, and, as every
one immediately ran to resume his place, some commotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
naturally ensued. In addition to being
lame, Mr. Huskisson seemed also under these circumstances
to be quite agitated, and, instead of
quietly standing against the side of the carriage and
allowing the <i>Rocket</i> to pass, he nervously tried to
get around the open carriage door, which was swinging
out across the space between the two tracks in
such a way that the approaching locomotive struck
it, flinging it back and at the same time throwing
Mr. Huskisson down. He fell on his face in the
open space between the tracks, but with his left leg
over the inner of the two rails upon which the
<i>Rocket</i> was moving, so that one of its wheels ran
obliquely up the limb to the thigh, crushing it
shockingly. As if to render the distressing circumstances
of the catastrophe complete, it so happened
that the unfortunate man had left his wife's side
when he got out of his carriage, and now he had been
flung down before her eyes as he sought to reënter
it. He was immediately raised, but he knew that
his hurt was mortal and his first exclamation was,
"I have met my death!" He was at once placed
on one of the state carriages, to which the <i>Northumbrian</i>
locomotive was attached, and in twenty-five
minutes was carried to Eccles, a distance of seventeen
miles, where medical assistance was obtained.
He was far beyond its reach, however, and upon
the evening of the same day, before his companions
of the morning had completed their journey, he was
dead. Some time after this accident a great public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
dinner was given at Liverpool in honor of the new
enterprise. Brougham was then at the height of an
unbounded popularity and just taking the fatal step
of his life, which led him out of the House of Commons
to the wool-sack and the Lords. Among the
excursionists of the opening day he had on the
16th, occasion to write a brief note to Macvey
Napier, editor of the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, in which he
thus alluded to the fatal accident which had marred
its pleasure:&mdash;"I have come to Liverpool only to
see a tragedy. Poor Huskisson is dead, or must die
before to-morrow. He has been killed by a steam
carriage. The folly of seven hundred people going
fifteen miles an hour, in six carriages, exceeds belief.
But they have paid a dear price." He was one
of the guests at the subsequent dinner, and made a
speech in which there was one passage of such exquisite
oratorical skill, that to read it is still a pleasure.
In it he at once referred to the wonders of the
system just inaugurated, and to the catastrophe
which had saddened its opening observances.
"When," he said, "I saw the difficulties of space,
as it were, overcome; when I beheld a kind of
miracle exhibited before my astonished eyes; when
I saw the rocks excavated and the gigantic power
of man penetrating through miles of the solid mass,
and gaining a great, a lasting, an almost perennial
conquest over the powers of nature by his skill and
industry; when I contemplated all this, was it possible
for me to avoid the reflections which crowded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
into my mind, not in praise of man's great success,
not in admiration of the genius and perseverance
he had displayed, or even of the courage he had
shown in setting himself against the obstacles that
matter afforded to his course&mdash;no! but the melancholy
reflection, that these prodigious efforts of the
human race, so fruitful of praise but so much more
fruitful of lasting blessings to mankind, have forced
a tear from my eye by that unhappy casualty which
deprived me of a friend and you of a representative!"</p>

<p>Though wholly attributable to his own carelessness,
the death of so prominent a character as Mr.
Huskisson, on such an occasion, could not but make
a deep impression on the public mind. The fact
that the dying man was carried seventeen miles in
twenty-five minutes in search of rest and medical
aid, served rather to stimulate the vague apprehension
which thereafter for a time associated itself with
the new means of transportation, and converted it
into a dangerous method of carriage which called
for no inconsiderable display of nerve on the part of
those using it. Indeed, as respects the safety of
travel by rail there is an edifying similarity between
the impressions which prevailed in England forty-five
years ago and those which prevail in China now;
for, when as recently as 1875 it was proposed to introduce
railroads into the Celestial Empire, a vigorous
native protest was fulminated against them, in
which, among other things scarcely less astounding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
it was alleged that "in all countries where railroads
exist they are considered a very dangerous mode of
locomotion, and, beyond those who have very urgent
business to transact, no one thinks of using them."</p>

<p>On this subject, however, of the dangers incident
to journeys by rail, a writer of nearly half a century
back, who has left us one of the earliest descriptions
of the Manchester &amp; Liverpool road, thus reassured
the public of those days, with a fresh quaintness of
style which lends a present value to his words:
"The occurrence of accidents is not so frequent as
might be imagined, as the great weight of the carriages"
(they weighed about one-tenth part as much
as those now in use in America) "prevents them
from easily starting off the rails; and so great is the
momentum acquired by these heavy loads moving
with such rapidity, that they easily pass over considerable
obstacles. Even in those melancholy accidents
where loss of life has been sustained, the
bodies of the unfortunate sufferers, though run over
by the wheels, have caused little irregularity in the
motion, and the passengers in the carriages have not
been sensible that any impediment has been encountered
on the road."</p>

<p>Indeed, from the time of Mr. Huskisson's death,
during a period of over eleven years, railroads enjoyed
a remarkable and most fortunate exemption
from accidents. During all that time there did not
occur a single disaster resulting in any considerable
loss of life; an immunity which seems to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
due to a variety of causes. Those early roads were,
in the first place, remarkably well and thoroughly
built, and were very cautiously operated under a
light volume of traffic. The precautions then taken
and the appliances in use would, it is true, strike the
modern railroad superintendent as both primitive
and comical; for instance, they involved the running
of independent pilot locomotives in advance of all
night passenger trains. Through all the years between
1830 and 1841, nevertheless, not a single really
serious railroad disaster had to be recorded. This
happy exemption was, however, quite as much due
to good fortune as to anything else, as was well illustrated
in the first accident at all serious in its
character, which occurred,&mdash;an accident in its every
circumstance, except loss of life, almost an exact
parallel to the famous Revere disaster which happened
nearly forty years later in Massachusetts. It
chanced on the Manchester &amp; Liverpool Railway on
December 23, 1832. The second-class morning train
had stopped at the Rainhill station to take in passengers,
when those upon it heard through the dense
fog another train, which had left Manchester forty-five
minutes later, coming towards them at a high
rate of speed. When it first became visible it was
but one hundred and fifty yards off, and a collision
was inevitable. Those in charge of the stationary
train, however, succeeded in getting it under a slight
headway, and in so much diminished the shock of
the collision; but, notwithstanding, the last five carriages
were injured, the one at the end being totally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
demolished. Though quite a number of the passengers
were cut and bruised, and several were severely
hurt, one only, strange to say, was killed.</p>

<p>Indeed, the luck&mdash;for it was nothing else&mdash;of those
earlier times was truly amazing. Thus on this same
Manchester &amp; Liverpool road, as a first-class train
on the morning of April 17, 1836, was moving at a
speed of some thirty miles an hour, an axle broke
under the first passenger coach, causing the whole
train to leave the track and throwing it down the
embankment, which at that point was twenty feet
high. The cars were rolled over, and the passengers
in them tumbled about topsy-turvey; nor, as
they were securely locked in, could they even extricate
themselves when at last the wreck of the
train reached firm bearings. And yet no one was
killed. Here the corporation was saved by one
chance in a thousand, and its almost miraculous good
fortune has since received numerous and terrible
illustrations. Among these two are worthy of a
more than passing mention. They happened one in
America and one in England, though with some interval
of time between them, and are curious as illustrating
very forcibly the peculiar dangers to which
those travelling by rail in the two countries are subjected
under almost precisely similar circumstances.
The American accident referred to was that popularly
known on account of its exceptionally harrowing
details as the "Angola horror," of December 18,
1867, while the English accident was that which occurred
at Shipton-on-Cherwell on December 24, 1874.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE ANGOLA AND SHIPTON ACCIDENTS.</h3>


<p>On the day of the Angola accident the eastern
bound express train over the Lake Shore road,
as it was then called, consisted of a locomotive,
four baggage, express and mail cars, an emigrant
and three first-class passenger coaches. It was
timed to pass Angola, a small way station in the
extreme western part of New York, at 1.30 <small>P.M.</small>,
without stopping; but on the day in question it was
two hours and forty-five minutes late, and was consequently
running rapidly. A third of a mile east
of the station there is a shallow stream, known as
Big Sister creek, flowing in the bottom of a ravine
the western side of which rises abruptly to the level
of the track, while on the eastern side there is a
gradual ascent of some forty or fifty rods. This
ravine was spanned by a deck bridge of 160 feet in
length, at the east end of which was an abutment
of mason work some fifty feet long connecting with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
an embankment beyond. It subsequently appeared
that the forward axle in the rear truck of the rear
car was slightly bent. The defect was not perceptible
to the eye, but in turning round the space between
the flanges of the wheels of that axle varied
by three-fourths of an inch. As long as the car was
travelling on an unbroken track, or as long as the
wheels did not strike any break in the track at their
narrowest point, this slight bend in the axle was of
no consequence. There was a frog in the track,
however, at a distance of 600 feet east of the Angola
station, and it so happened that a wheel of the
defective axle struck this frog in such a way as to
make it jump the track. The rear car was instantly
derailed. From the frog to the bridge was some
1200 feet. With the appliances then in use the
train could not be stopped in this space, and the
car was dragged along over the ties, swaying violently
from side to side. Just before the bridge
was reached the car next to the last was also thrown
from the track, and in this way, and still moving at
considerable speed, the train went onto the bridge.
It was nearly across when the last car toppled off
and fell on the north side close to the abutment.
The car next to the rear, more fortunate, was
dragged some 270 feet further, so that when it
broke loose it simply slid some thirty feet down
the embankment. Though this car was badly
wrecked, but a single person in it was killed. His
death was a very singular one. Before the car<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
separated from the train, its roof broke in two transversely;
through the fissure thus made this unfortunate
passenger was partly flung, and it then instantly
closed upon him.</p>

<p>The other car had fallen fifty feet, and remained
resting on its side against the abutment with one
end inclined sharply downward. It was mid-winter
and cold, and, as was the custom then, the car was
heated by two iron stoves, placed one at each end,
in which wood was burned. It was nearly full of
passengers. Naturally they all sprang from their
seats in terror and confusion as their car left the
rails, so that when it fell from the bridge and violently
struck on one of its ends, they were precipitated
in an inextricable mass upon one of the overturned
stoves, while the other fell upon them from
above. A position more horrible could hardly be
imagined. Few, if any, were probably killed outright.
Some probably were suffocated; the greatest
number were undoubtedly burned to death. Of
those in that car three only escaped; forty-one are
supposed to have perished.</p>

<p>This was a case of derailment aggravated by fire.
It is safe to say that with the improved appliances
since brought into use, it would be most unlikely to
now occur under precisely the same circumstances
on any well-equipped or carefully operated road.
Derailments, of course, by broken axles or wheels
are always possible, but the catastrophe at Angola
was primarily due to the utter inability of those on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the train to stop it, or even greatly to check its speed
within any reasonable distance. Before it finally
stood still the locomotive was half a mile from the
frog and 1,500 feet from the bridge. Thus, when the
rear cars were off the track, the speed and distance
they were dragged gave them a lateral and violently
swinging motion, which led to the final result.
Though under similar circumstances now this might
not happen, there is no reason why, circumstances
being varied a little, the country should not again
during any winter day be shocked by another Angola
sacrifice. Certainly, so far as the danger from fire is
concerned, it is an alarming fact that it is hardly less
in 1879 than it was in 1867. This accumulative
horror is, too, one of the distinctive features of
American railroad accidents. In other countries
holocausts like those at Versailles in 1842 and at
Abergele in 1868 have from time to time taken place.
They are, however, occasioned in other ways, and, as
their occurrence is not regularly challenged by the
most risky possible of interior heating apparatus,
are comparatively infrequent. The passenger coaches
used on this side of the Atlantic, with their light
wood-work heavily covered with paint and varnish,
are at best but tinder-boxes. The presence in them
of stoves, hardly fastened to the floor and filled with
burning wood and coal, involves a degree of risk
which no one would believe ever could willingly be
incurred, but for the fact that it is. No invention
yet appears to have wholly met the requirements of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the case. That they will be met, and the fearful
possibility which now hangs over the head of every
traveller by rail, that he may suddenly find himself
doomed without possibility of escape to be roasted
alive, will be at least greatly reduced hardly admits
of question.</p>

<p>Turning now from the American to the English
accident, it is singular to note how under very similar
circumstances much the same fatality resulted from
wholly different causes. It happened on the day
immediately preceding Christmas, and every train
which at that holiday season leaves London is
densely packed, for all England seems then to gather
away from its cities to the country hearths. Accordingly,
the ten o'clock London express on the
Great Western Railway, when it left Oxford that
morning, was made up of no less than fifteen passenger
carriages and baggage vans, drawn by two powerful
locomotives and containing nearly three hundred
passengers. About seven miles north of Oxford, as
the train, moving at a speed of some thirty to forty
miles an hour, was rounding a gentle curve in the approach
to the bridge over the little river Cherwell, the
tire of one of the wheels of the passenger coach next
behind the locomotive broke, throwing it off the track.
For a short distance it was dragged along in its
place; but almost immediately those in charge of
the locomotives noticed that something was wrong,
and, most naturally and with the very best of intensions,
they instantly did the very worst thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
which under the circumstances it was in their power
to do,&mdash;they applied their brakes and reversed their
engines; their single thought was to stop the train.
With the train equipped as it was, however, had
these men, instead of crowding on their brakes and
reversing their engines, simply shut off their steam
and by a gentle application of the brakes checked
the speed gradually and so as to avoid any strain on
the couplings, the carriages would probably have held
together and remained upon the road-bed. Instead
of this, however, the sudden checking of the two
ponderous locomotives converted them into an anvil,
as it were, upon which the unfortunate leading carriage
already off the rails was crushed under the
weight and impetus of those behind it. The train instantly
zig-zagged in every direction under the pressure,
the couplings which connected it together snapping,
and the carriages, after leaving the rails to the
right and left and running down the embankment of
about thirteen feet in height, came to a stand-still at
last, several of them in the reverse order from that
which they had held while in the train. The first
carriage was run over and completely destroyed;
the five rear ones were left alone upon the road-bed,
and of these two only were on the rails; of the ten
which went down the embankment, two were demolished.
In this disaster thirty-four passengers
lost their lives, and sixty-five others, besides four
employés of the company, were injured.</p>

<p>At the time it occurred the Shipton accident was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the subject of a good deal of discussion, and both the
brake system and method of car construction in use
on English roads were sharply criticised. It was
argued, and apparently with much reason, that had
the "locomotives and cars been equipped with the
continuous train-brakes so generally in use in America,
the action of the engine drivers would have checked
at the same instant the speed of each particular car,
and probably any serious accident would have been
averted." Yet it required another disaster, not so
fatal as that at Shipton-on-Cherwell but yet sufficiently
so, to demonstrate that this was true only in
a limited degree,&mdash;to further illustrate and enforce
the apparently obvious principle that, no matter
how heavy the construction may be, or what train-brake
is in use, to insure safety the proportion between
the resisting strength of car construction and
the train-weight momentum to which it may be subjected
must be carefully preserved.</p>

<p>On this point of the resisting power of modern
car construction, indeed, it seemed as if a result had
been reached which did away with the danger of
longitudinal crushing. Between 1873 and 1878 a
series of accidents had occurred on the American
roads of which little was heard at the time for the
simple reason that they involved no loss of life,&mdash;they
belonged in the great category of possible
disasters which might have happened, had they not
been prevented. Trains going in opposite directions
and at full speed had come in collision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
while rounding curves; trains had run into earth-slides,
and had been suddenly stopped by derailment;
in every such case, however, the Westinghouse
brake and the Miller car construction had, when in
use, proved equal to the emergency and the passengers
on the trains had escaped uninjured. The
American mechanic had accordingly grown firm in
his belief that, so far as any danger from the crushing
of cars was concerned,&mdash;unless indeed they were
violently thrown down an embankment or precipitated
into an abyss,&mdash;the necessary resisting strength
had been secured and the problem practically solved.
That such was not the case in America in 1878 any
more than in England in 1875, except within certain
somewhat narrow limits, was unexpectedly
proven by a disaster which occurred at Wollaston
near Boston, on the Old Colony road, upon the
evening of October 8, 1878.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE WOLLASTON ACCIDENT.</h3>


<p>A large party of excursionists were returning from
a rowing match on a special train consisting of two
locomotives and twenty-one cars. There had been
great delay in getting ready for the return, so that
when it neared Wollaston the special was much behind
the time assigned for it. Meanwhile a regular
freight train had left Boston, going south and occupying
the outward track. At Wollaston those in
charge of this train had occasion to stop for the
purpose of taking up some empty freight cars, which
were standing on a siding at that place; and to
reach this siding it was necessary for them to cross
the inward track, temporarily disconnecting it.
The freight train happened to be short-handed,
and both its conductor and engineer supposed that
the special had reached Boston before they had
started out. Accordingly, in direct violation of the
rules of the road and with a negligence which admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of no excuse, they disconnected the inward
track in both directions and proceeded to occupy
it in the work of shunting, without sending out
any signals or taking any precautions to protect
themselves or any incoming train. It was after
dark, and, though the switches were supplied with
danger signals, these were obscured by the glare of
the locomotive head-light. Under these circumstances
the special neared the spot. What ensued
was a curious illustration of those narrow escapes
through which, by means of improved appliances or
by good luck, railroad accidents do not happen; and
an equally curious illustration of those trifling derangements
which now and again bring them about.
In this case there was no collision, though a freight train
was occupying the inward track in front of the
special. There should have been no derailment,
though the track was broken at two points. There
would have been no accident, had there been no attempt
made to avert one. Seeing the head-light of
the approaching special, while yet it was half a mile
off, the engineer of the freight train realizing the
danger had put on all steam, and succeeded, though
by a very narrow margin, in getting his locomotive
and all the cars attached to it off of the inward
track and onto the outward, out of the way of the
special. The inward track was thus clear, though
broken at two points. The switches at those points
were, however, of the safety pattern, and, if they were
left alone and did their work, the special would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
simply leave the main track and pass into the
siding, and there be stopped. Unfortunately the
switches were not left alone. The conductor of the
freight train had caught sight of the head-light of
the approaching locomotive at about the same time
as the engineer of that train. He seems at once to
have realized the possible consequences of his reckless
neglect of precautions, and his one thought was
to do something to avert the impending disaster.
In a sort of dazed condition, he sprang from the
freight car on which he was standing and ran to the
lever of the siding switch, which he hastened to
throw. He apparently did not have time enough
within perhaps five seconds. Had he succeeded in
throwing it, the train would have gone on to Boston,
those upon it simply knowing from the jar they had
received in passing over the first frog that a switch
had been set wrong. Had he left it alone, the special
would have passed into the siding and there been
stopped. As it was, the locomotive of the special
struck the castings of the switch just when it was
half thrown&mdash;at the second when it was set neither
the one way nor the other&mdash;and the wreck followed.
It was literally the turning of a hand.</p>

<p>As it approached the point where the disaster
occurred the special train was running at a moderate
rate of speed, not probably exceeding twenty miles
an hour. The engineer of its leading locomotive also
perceived his danger in time to signal it and to reverse
his engine while yet 700 feet from the point where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
derailment took place. The train-brake was necessarily
under the control of the engineer of the
second locomotive, but the danger signal was immediately
obeyed by him, his locomotive reversed
and the brake applied. The train was, however,
equipped with the ordinary Westinghouse, and not
the improved automatic or self-acting brake of that
name. That is, it depended for its efficiency on the
perfectness of its parts, and, in case the connecting
tubes were broken or the valves deranged, the brake-blocks
did not close upon the wheels, as they do
under the later improvements made by Westinghouse
in his patents, but at best remained only partially
set, or in such positions as they were when
the parts of the brake were broken. As is perfectly
well understood, the original Westinghouse does
not work quickly or effectively through more than a
certain number of cars. Twelve is generally regarded
as the limit of practical simultaneous action.
The 700 feet of interval between the point where
the brakes were applied and that where the accident
occurred,&mdash;a distance which, at the rate at which
the train was moving, it could hardly have passed
over in less than twenty-two seconds,&mdash;should have
afforded an ample space within which to stop the
train. When the derailment took place, however,
it was still moving at a considerable rate of speed.
Both locomotives, the baggage car and six following
passenger cars left the rails. The locomotives,
after going a short distance, swung off to the left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and toppled over, presenting an insuperable barrier
to the direct movement of the cars following.</p>

<p>Those cars were of the most approved form of
American construction, but here, as at Shipton, the
violent application of the train-brakes and reversal
of the locomotives had greatly checked the speed
of the forward part of the train, while the whole
rear of it, comparatively free from brake pressure,
was crowding heavily forward. Including its living
freight, the entire weight of the train could not
have been less than 500 tons. There was no slack
between its parts; no opportunity to give. It was
a simple question of the resisting power of car
construction. Had the train consisted of ten cars
instead of twenty-two a recent experience of a not
dissimilar accident on this very road affords sufficient
evidence of how different the result would have
been. On the occasion referred to,&mdash;October 13,
1876,&mdash;a train consisting of two locomotives and
fourteen cars, while rounding a curve before the
Randolph station at a speed of thirty miles an hour
came in sudden collision with the locomotive of a
freight train which was occupying the track, and
while doing so, in that case also as at Wollaston,
had wholly neglected to protect it. So short was
the notice of danger that the speed of the passenger
train could not at the moment of collision have
been less than twenty miles an hour. The freight
train was at the moment fortunately backing, but
none the less it was an impassable obstacle. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
three locomotives were entirely thrown from the
track and more or less broken up, and three cars of
the passenger train followed them, but the rest of it
remained in line and on the rails, and was so entirely
uninjured that it was not found necessary to withdraw
one of the cars from service for even a single
trip. Not a passenger was hurt. This train consisted
of fourteen cars: but at Wollaston, the fourteen
forward cars were, after the head of the train
was derailed, driven onward not only by their
own momentum but also by the almost unchecked
momentum of eight other cars behind them. The
rear of the train did not leave the rails and was freely
moving along them. By itself it must have
weighed over 200 tons. The result was inevitable.
Something had to yield; and the six forward cars
were accordingly either thrown wholly to the one
side or the other, or crushed between the two locomotives
and the rear of the train. Two of them in
fact were reduced into a mere mass of fragments.
The disaster resulted in the death of 19 persons,
while a much greater number were injured, more
than 50 seriously. In this as in most other railroad
disasters the surprising thing was that the list of
casualties was not larger. Looking at the position
of the two cars crushed into fragments it seemed almost
impossible that any person in them could have
escaped alive. Indeed that they did so was largely
due to the fact that the season for car-warming had
not yet arrived, while, in some way impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
explain, all four of the men in charge of the locomotives,
though flung violently through the air into the
trees and ditch at the side of the road were neither
stunned nor seriously injured. They were consequently
able, as soon as they could gather themselves
up, to take the measures necessary to extinguish
the fires in their locomotives which otherwise
would speedly have spread to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> of the
train. Had they not done so nothing could have
saved the large number of passengers confined in the
shattered cars.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>ACCIDENTS AND CONSERVATISM.</h3>


<p>The four accidents which have been referred to,
including that of April 17, 1836, upon the Manchester
&amp; Liverpool road, belong to one class. Though they
covered a period of forty-two years they were all
due to the same cause, the sudden derailment of a
portion of the train, and its subsequent destruction
because of the insufficient control of those in charge
of it over its momentum. In the three earlier cases
the appliances in use were much the same, for between
1836 and 1874 hardly any improvement as respects
brakes had either forced its own way, or been
forced by the government, into general acceptance
in Great Britain. The Wollaston disaster, on the
other hand, revealed a weak point in an improved
appliance; the old danger seemed, indeed, to take a
sort of pleasure in baffling human ingenuity. The
Shipton accident, however, while one of the most
fatal which ever occurred was also one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
fruitful in results. This, and the accident of April
17, 1836, upon the Manchester &amp; Liverpool road
were almost precisely similar, though no less than
thirty-eight years intervened between them. In the
case of the first, however, no one was killed and
consequently it was wholly barren of results; for
experience has shown that to bring about any considerable
reform, railroad disasters have, as it were,
to be emphasized by loss of life. This, however,
implies nothing more than the assertion that those
responsible for the management of railroads do not
differ from other men,&mdash;that they are apt, after some
hair-breadth escape, to bless their fortunate stars for
the present good rather than to take anxious heed
for future dangers.</p>

<p>At the time the Shipton accident occurred the
success of the modern train-brake, which places the
speed of each of the component parts of the train
under the direct and instantaneous control of him
who is in charge of the locomotive, had for years
been conceded even by the least progressive of
American railroad managers. The want of such a
brake and the absence of proper means of communication
between the parts of the train had directly
and obviously caused the murderous destructiveness
of the accident. Yet in the investigation which ensued
it appeared that the authorities of the Great
Western Railway, being eminently "practical men,"
still entertained as respected the train-brake "very
grave doubts of the wisdom of adopting [it] at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
all;" while at the same time, as respected a means
of communication between the parts of the train, it
appeared that the associated general managers of
the leading railways "did not think that any [such]
means of communication was at all required, or
likely to be useful or successful."</p>

<p>Though quite incomprehensible, there is at the
same time something superb in such an exhibition
of stolid conservatism. It is British. It is, however,
open to but one description of argument, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultima
ratio</i> of railroad logic. So long as luck averted the
loss of life in railroad disasters, no occasion would
ever have been seen for disturbing time-honored
precautions or antiquated appliances. While, how
ever, a disaster like that of December 24, 1874,
might not convince, it did compel: in spite of professed
"grave doubts," incredulity and conservatism
vanished, silenced, at least, in presence of so frightful
a row of corpses as on that morning made ghastly
the banks of the Cherwell. The general, though
painfully slow and reluctant, introduction of train-brakes
upon the railways of Great Britain may be
said to have dated from that event.</p>

<p>In the matter of communication between those in
the train and those in charge of it, the Shipton corpses
chanced not to be witnesses to the precise point.
Accordingly their evidence was, so to speak, ruled
out of the case, and neither the utility nor the success
of any appliance for this purpose was held to be
yet proven. What further proof would be deemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
conclusive did not appear, but the history of the
discussion before and since is not without value.
There is, indeed, something almost ludicrously characteristic
in the manner with which those interested
in the railway management of Great Britain strain
at their gnats while they swallow their camels. They
have grappled with the great question of city travel
with a superb financial and engineering sagacity,
which has left all other communities hopelessly distanced;
but, while carrying their passengers under
and over the ebb and flow of the Thames and
among the chimney pots of densest London to leave
them on the very steps of the Royal Exchange, they
have never been able to devise any satisfactory
means for putting the traveller, in case of a disaster
to the carriage in which he happens to be, in communication
with the engine-driver of his train. An
English substitute for the American bell-cord has
for more than thirty years set the ingenuity of
Great Britain at defiance.</p>

<p>As long ago as the year 1857, in consequence of
two accidents to trains by fires, a circular on this subject
was issued to the railway companies by the
Board of Trade, in which it was stated that "from
the beginning of the year 1854, down to the present
time (December, 1857) there have been twenty-six
cases in which either the accidents themselves or
some of the ulterior consequences of the accidents
would probably have been avoided had such a means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of communication existed."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> As none of these accidents
had resulted in any considerable number of
funerals the railway managers wholly failed to see
the propriety of this circular, or the necessity of taking
any steps in consequence of it. As, however,
accidents from this cause were still reported, and
with increasing frequency, the authorities in July,
1864, again bestirred themselves and issued another
circular in which it was stated that "several instances
have occurred of carriages having taken fire, or
having been thrown off the rails, the passengers in
which had no means of making their perilous situation
known to the servants of the company in
charge of the train. Recent occurrences also of a
criminal nature in passenger railway trains have excited
among the public a very general feeling of
alarm." The last reference was more particularly to
the memorable Briggs murder, which had taken
place only a few days before on July 9th, and was
then absorbing the public attention to the almost
entire exclusion of everything else.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p>As no better illustration than this can be found of
the extreme slowness with which the necessity for
new railroad appliances is recognized in cases where
profit is not involved, and of the value of wholesale
slaughters, like those at Shipton and Angola, as a
species of motive force in the direction of progress, a
digression on the subject of English accidents due to
the absence of bell-cords may be not without value.
In the opinion of the railway managers the cases
referred to by the Board of Trade officials failed to
show the existence of any necessity for providing
means of communication between portions of the
train. A detailed statement of a few of the cases
thus referred to will not only be found interesting
in itself, but it will give some idea of the description
of evidence which is considered insufficient. The
circumstances of the Briggs murder, deeply interesting
as they were, are too long for incidental statement;
this, however, is not the case with some of
the other occurrences. For instance, the Board of
Trade circular was issued on July 30th; on July 7th,
a year earlier, the following took place on the London
&amp; North Western road.</p>

<p>Two gentlemen took their seats at Liverpool in
one of the compartments of the express train to
London. In it they found already seated an elderly
lady and a large, powerfully built man, apparently
Irish, respectably dressed, but with a lowering, suspicious
visage. Though one of the two gentlemen
noticed this peculiarity as he entered the carriage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
he gave no thought to it, but, going on with their
conversation, he and his friend took their seats, and
in a few moments the train started. Scarcely was it
out of the station when the stranger changed his
seat, placing himself on the other side of the carriage,
close to the window, and at the same time, in
a menacing way, incoherently muttering something
to himself. The other passengers looked at him,
but felt no particular alarm, and for a time he remained
quietly in his seat. He then suddenly sprang
up, and, with a large clasp-knife in his hand, rushed
at one of the gentlemen, a Mr. Warland by name,
and struck him on the forehead, the knife sliding
along the bone and inflicting a frightful flesh wound.
As he was in the act of repeating the blow, Warland's
companion thrust him back upon the seat. This
seemed to infuriate him, and starting to his feet he
again tried to attack the wounded man. A frightful
struggle ensued. It was a struggle for life, in a narrow
compartment feebly lighted, for it was late at
night, on a train running at full speed and with no
stopping place for eighty miles. The passenger who
had not been hurt clutched the maniac by the throat
with one hand and grasped his knife with the other,
but only to feel the blade drawn through his fingers,
cutting them to the bone. The unfortunate elderly
woman, the remaining occupant of the compartment,
after screaming violently in her terror for a few moments,
fainted away and fell upon the floor. The
struggle nevertheless went on among the three men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
until at last, though blinded with blood and weak
from its loss, the wounded Mr. Warland got behind
his assailant and threw him down, in which position
the two succeeded in holding him, he striking
and stabbing at both of them with his knife, shouting
loudly all the time, and desperately endeavoring
to rise and throw them off. They finally, however,
got his knife away from him, and then kept
him down until the train at last drew up at Camdentown
station. When the ticket collector opened
the compartment door at that place he found
the four passengers on the floor, the woman senseless
and two of the men holding the third, while
the faces and clothing of all of them, together
with seats, floor, windows and sides of the carriage
were covered with blood or smeared with finger
marks.</p>

<p>The assailant in this case, as it subsequently appeared
upon his commitment for an assault, was
a schoolmaster who had come over from Ireland
to a competitive examination. He was insane, of
course, but before the magistrate he made a statement
which had in it something quite touching;
he said that he saw the two gentlemen talking
together, and, as he thought, making motions towards
him; he believed them to be thieves who
intended to rob him, and so he thought that he
could not do better than defend himself, "if only
for his dear little ones at home."</p>

<p>This took place before the Board of Trade circular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
was issued, but, as if to give emphasis to it, a few
days only after its issue, in August, 1864, there was
a not dissimilar occurrence in a third class carriage
between London and Peterborough. The running
distance was in this case eighty miles without a stop,
and occupied generally an hour and fifty minutes,&mdash;the
rate being forty-three miles an hour. In the
compartment in question were five passengers, one
of whom, a tall powerful fellow, was dressed like a
sailor. The train was hardly out of London when
this man, after searching his pockets for a moment,
cried out that he had been robbed of his purse containing
£17, and began violently to shout and gesticulate.
He then tried to clamber through the window,
getting his body and one leg out, and when his
fellow passengers, catching hold of his other leg, succeeded
in hauling him back, he turned savagely upon
them and a desperate struggle ensued. At last he
was gotten down by main force and bound to a seat.
Meanwhile, notwithstanding the speed at which they
were running, the noise of the struggle was heard in
the adjoining compartments, and almost frantic
efforts were made to stop the train. Word was
passed from carriage to carriage for a short distance,
but it proved impossible to communicate with the
guard, or to do anything but thoroughly alarm the
passengers. These merely knew that something was
the matter,&mdash;what, they could only imagine,&mdash;and
so the run to Peterborough was completed amid
shouts of "stop the train," interspersed with frantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
female shrieks. The man was suffering from <i>delirium
tremens</i>.</p>

<p>About a year later, in December, 1865, a similar
case occurred which, however, had in it strong elements
of the ludicrous. A clergyman, laboring
under great indignation and excitement, and without
the slightest sense of the ridiculous, recounted
his experience in a communication to the <cite>Times</cite>.
He had found himself alone in a compartment of an
express train in which were also a young lady and a
man, both total strangers to him. Shortly after the
train started the man began to give unmistakable
indications of something wrong. He made no
attempt at any violence on either of his fellow passengers,
but he was noisy, and presently he proceeded
to disrobe himself and otherwise to indulge in antics
which were even more indecent than they were extraordinary.
The poor clergyman,&mdash;a respected incumbent
of the established church returning to the
bosom of his family,&mdash;was in a most distressing
situation. At first he attempted remonstrance.
This, however, proved worse than unavailing, and
there was nothing for it but to have recourse to his
umbrella, behind the sheltering cover of which he
protected the modesty of the young lady, while
over its edges he himself from time to time effected
observations through an apparently interminable
journey of forty and more miles.</p>

<p>These and numerous other cases of fires, murders,
assaults and indecencies had occurred and filled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
columns of the newspapers, without producing the
slightest effect on the managers of the railway companies.
No attention was paid by them to the
Board of Trade circulars. At last Parliament took
the matter up and in 1868 an act was passed, making
compulsory some "efficient means of communication
between the passenger and the servants of the company
in charge" of railroad trains. Yet when six
years later in 1874 the Shipton accident occurred,
and was thought to be in some degree attributable
to the absence of the very means of communication
thus made compulsory, it appeared, as has been seen,
that the associated general managers did not yet
consider any such means of communication either
required or likely to be useful.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as if in ironical comment on such
measured utterances, occurrences like the following,
which took place as recently as the early part of
1878, from time to time still meet the eye in the
columns of the English press:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A burglar was being taken in a third-class carriage
from London to Sheffield. When about twelve miles
from Sheffield he asked that the windows might be
opened. This was no sooner done than he took a dive
out through the aperture. One of the warders succeeded
in catching him by a foot, and for two miles he hung head
downward suspended by one foot and making terrific
struggles to free himself. In vain he wriggled, for although
his captors were unable to catch the other foot,
both held him as in a vise. But he wore spring-sided
boots, and the one on which his fate seemingly depended
came off. The burglar fell heavily on the foot-board of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the carriage and rolled off on the railway. Three miles
further on the train stopped, and the warders went back
to the scene of the escape. Here they found him in the
snow bleeding from a wound on the head. During the
time he was struggling with the warders the warder who
had one hand free and the passengers of the other compartments
who were witnessing the scene from the windows
of the train were indefatigable in their efforts to attract
the attention of the guards by means of the communication
cord, but with no result. For two miles the unfortunate
man hung head downward, and for three miles further
the train ran until it stopped at an ordinary resting place."</p></blockquote>

<p>A single further example will more than sufficiently
illustrate this instance of British railroad conservatism,
and indicate the tremendous nature of the
pressure which has been required to even partially
force the American bell-cord into use in that country.
One day, in the latter part of 1876, a Mr. A. J.
Ellis of Liverpool had occasion to go to Chester.
On his way there he had an experience with a lunatic,
which he subsequently recounted before a magistrate
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On Friday last I took the 10.35 <small>A.M.</small>, train from Lime
Street in a third-class carriage, my destination being
Chester. At Edge Hill Station the prisoner and another
man, whom I afterward understood to be the prisoner's
father, got into the same compartment, no one else being
in the same compartment. The other person was much
under the influence of drink when he entered, and was
very noisy during the journey. The prisoner had the appearance
of having been drinking, but was quiet. I sat
with my back to the engine, on the getting-out side of the
carriage; prisoner was sitting on the opposite side, with
his right arm to the window, and the other person was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
sitting on the same side as prisoner, about the middle of
the seat. I was engaged reading, and did not exchange
words with the prisoner.</p>

<p>"After we had passed over Runcorn bridge and through
the station, I perceived the prisoner make a start, and
looking toward him saw a white-hafted knife in his hand,
about five inches long, with the blade open. He held it
in his right hand in a menacing manner. Drawing his
left hand along the edge of the blade, he said, "This will
have to go into some &mdash;&mdash;." At that moment he looked
at me across the carriage; he was on his feet in an instant,
and looking across to me, he said, "You &mdash;&mdash;, this will
have to go into you," and made a bound toward me. The
other jumped up and tried to prevent him. The prisoner
threw him away; he made a plunge at my throat. I
caught his wrist just as he advanced, and struggled with
him, still holding fast to his wrist with both hands. We
fell over and under one another two or three times, and
eventually he overpowered me. I had fallen on my side
on the seat, but still retained my hold upon his wrist.
While lying in that position he held the knife down to
within an inch of my throat. I called to the other man
to hold the prisoner's hand back which contained the
knife, and by that means he saved my life. I was growing
powerless, and as the other man restrained the prisoner
from using the knife, I jerked myself from his grasp, and
knocked the knife out of the prisoner's hand with my left
hand.</p>

<p>"The prisoner eluded the grip of his father, and falling
on his knees began to seek for his knife. Failing to find
the knife, he was instantly on his feet, and made a spring
upon me. If I recollect aright, he threw his arms around
my neck, and in this manner we struggled together up
and down the carriage for some minutes, during which
time he got my left thumb (with a glove on at the time)
in his mouth, and bit it. Still retaining my thumb in his
mouth, the other man struck him under the chin, when he
released it, and fell on his knees seeking the knife, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
he did not find. He was immediately on his feet, and
again made a spring upon me. We had then a very long
and desperate struggle, when he overpowered me and
pinned me in a corner of the compartment. At last he
got my right thumb into his mouth, holding my hand to
steady it with both his hands while he bit it. With a
great effort he then bit my thumb off, clean to the bone.
I had no glove on that hand. I called to the other man
to help me, but he seemed stupefied. He called two or
three times to the prisoner, 'Leave the poor man alone.
The poor man has done thee no harm.' Though sitting
within nine inches of my knees he rendered me no help.</p>

<p>"When the prisoner bit my thumb off, he held it in his
mouth; he pushed his head through the glass, spat the
thumb into his hand and flung it out through the window.
I then stood up and put my left hand in my pocket, took
out my purse and cried out: 'If it is money you want
take all I have.' He made a grab at the purse and flung
it through the window, on the same side as the thumb
was thrown out. From this act I inferred that I was struggling
with a maniac. I retreated to the other end of the
compartment, holding the other man between me and the
prisoner, but he passed the other man by jumping over
the seat and again got hold of me. Then he forced his
head through the other window, breaking the glass, and,
loosing me for a moment, with his fists smashed the remaining
glass in the window. Addressing me he said:
'You &mdash;&mdash;, you will have to go over;' at the same time
he flung both his arms around my waist. I put my leg
behind his and threw him on his back. I called upon the
other man to help me and he did so.</p>

<p>"We held him down for some time, but he overpowered
us and flung us back some distance. He then laid hold
of my travelling rug and threw it through the window.
Laying his hand on the bottom of the window he cried
out, 'Here goes,' and made a leap through the window.
I and the other man instantly laid hold of his legs as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
was falling over. I got my four fingers into his right
shoe, and, his father assisting me, we held him through
the window, hanging head downward for about half a
mile. I then fainted, and as I was losing my hold on his
heels I have some faint recollection that the prisoner's
father lost his hold at the same time, and I can't say
what happened afterward. As I was coming to myself
the train was stopping, and I heard the other man say,
'Oh, my son, my son.' When the train stopped I walked
from the carriage to the station, and Dr. Robinson, who
was sent for, came in about an hour and amputated my
thumb further back."</p></blockquote>

<p>While thus referring, however, to this instance of
British railroad conservatism, which with a stolid
indifference seems to ignore the teachings of every
day life and to meet constantly recurring experience
with a calm defiance, it will not do for the
American railroad manager to pride himself too
much on his own greater ingenuity and more amenable
disposition. The Angola disaster has been referred
to, as well as that at Shipton. If the absence
of the bell-cord had indeed any part in the fatality of
the latter, the presence in cars crowded with passengers
of iron pots full of living fire lent horrors before
almost unheard of to the former. The methods of
accomplishing needed results which are usual to any
people are never easily changed, whether in Europe
or in America; but certainly the disasters which
have first and last ensued from the failure to devise
any safe means of heating passenger coaches in this
country are out of all proportion to those which can
be attributed in England to the absence of means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
communication between the passengers on trains and
those in charge of them. There is an American
conservatism as well as an English; and when it
comes to a question of running risks it would be
strange indeed if the greater margin of security were
found west of the Atlantic. The security afforded
by the bell-cord assuredly has not as yet in this
country off-set the danger incident to red-hot stoves.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>TELESCOPING AND THE MILLER PLATFORM.</h3>


<p>The period of exemption from wholesale railroad
slaughters referred to in a previous chapter and
which fortunately marked the early days of the
system, seems to have lasted some eleven years.
The record of great catastrophes opened on the
Great Western railway of England, and it opened
also, curiously enough, upon the 24th of December,
a day which seems to have been peculiarly unfortunate
in the annals of that corporation, seeing
that it was likewise the date of the Shipton-on-Cherwell
disaster. Upon that day, in 1841, a train,
while moving through a thick fog at a high rate of
speed, came suddenly in contact with a mass of
earth that had slid down upon the track from the
slope of the cutting. Instantly the whole rear of
the train was piled up on the top of the first carriage,
which happened to be crowded with passengers,
eight of whom were killed on the spot while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
seventeen others were more or less injured. The
coroner's jury returned a verdict of accidental death,
and at the same time, as if to give the corporation
a forcible hint to look closer to the condition of its
roadway, a "deodand" of one hundred pounds was
levied on the locomotive and tender. This practice,
by the way, of levying a deodand in cases of railroad
accidents resulting in loss of life, affords a curious
illustration of how seldom those accidents
must have occurred. The mere mention of it now
as ever having existed sounds almost as strange and
unreal as would an assertion that the corporations
had in their earlier days been wont to settle their
differences by wager of battle. Like the wager of
battle, the deodand was a feature of the English
common law derived from the feudal period. It was
nothing more nor less than a species of fine, everything
through the instrumentality of which accidental
death occurred being forfeited to the crown; or, in
lieu of the thing itself, its supposed money value as
assessed by a coroner's jury.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Accordingly, down to
somewhere about the year 1847, when the practice
was finally abolished by act of Parliament, we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
in all cases of English railroad accidents resulting
in death, mention of the deodand assessed by coroner's
juries on the locomotives. These appear to
have been arbitrarily fixed, and graduated in amount
as the circumstances of the particular accident
seemed to excite in greater or less degree the sympathies
or the indignation of the jury. In November,
1838, for instance, a locomotive exploded on the
Manchester &amp; Liverpool road, killing its engineer
and fireman: and for this escapade a deodand of
twenty pounds was assessed upon it by the coroner's
jury; while upon another occasion, in 1839, where
the locomotive struck and killed a man and horse at
a street crossing, the deodand was fixed at no less a
sum than fourteen hundred pounds, the full value of
the engine. Yet in this last case there did not appear
to be any circumstances rendering the corporation
liable in civil damages. The deodand seems to
have been looked upon as a species of rude penalty
imposed on the use of dangerous appliances,&mdash;a
sharp reminder to the corporations to look closely
after their locomotives and employés. As, however,
accidents increased in frequency it became
painfully apparent that "crowner's 'quest law" was
not in any appreciable degree better calculated to
command the public respect in the days of Victoria
than in those of Elizabeth, and the ancient usage
was accordingly at last abolished. Certainly the
position of railroad corporations would now be even
more hazardous than it is, if, after every catastrophe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
resulting in death, the coroner's jury of the vicinage
enjoyed the power of arbitrarily imposing on them
such additional penalty not exceeding the value of
a locomotive, in addition to all other liabilities, as
might seem to it proper under the circumstances of
the case.</p>

<p>Recurring, however, to the accident of December
24, 1861, the numerous casualties in that case were
due to the crushing of the rolling stock which was
not strong enough to resist the shock of the sudden
stop. Under these circumstances the light, short
English carriages rode over each other and were
broken to pieces; under similar circumstances the
longer and heavier cars then in use in America would
have "telescoped;" that is, the platforms between
the cars would have been broken off and the forward
end of each car riding slightly up on its broken
coupling would have shot in over the floor of the
car before it, sweeping away the studding and other
light wood-work and crushing stoves, seats and
passengers into one inextricable mass, until, if the
momentum was sufficiently great, the several vehicles
in the train would be enclosed in each other
somewhat like the slides of a partially shut telescope.</p>

<p>Crushing in other countries and telescoping in
America were formerly the greatest, if not the worst,
dangers to which travel by rail was liable. As respects
crushing there is little to be said. It is a
mere question of proportions,&mdash;resisting strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
opposed to momentum. So long as trains go at
great speed it is inevitable that they will occasionally
be brought to a dead-stand by running upon
unexpected obstacles. The simple wonder is that
they do this so infrequently. When, however, now
and again, they are thus brought to a dead-stand
the safety of the passenger depends and can depend
on nothing but the strength of the car in
which he is sitting as measured by the force of the
shock to which it is subjected. This matter has
already been referred to in connection with the
Shipton and Wollaston accidents,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the last of
which was a significant reminder to all railroad
managers that no matter how strongly or with how
careful a regard to scientific principles cars may be
constructed, just so long as they are made by
human hands it is easy to load on weight sufficient,
when combined with only a moderate momentum,
to crush them into splinters.</p>

<p>Telescoping, however, was an incident of crushing,
and a peculiarly American incident, which is
not without a certain historical interest; for the particular
feature in car construction which led directly
to it and all its attendant train of grisly horrors
furnishes a singular and instructive illustration of
the gross violations of mechanical principles into
which practical, as opposed to educated, mechanics
are apt constantly to fall,&mdash;and in which, when
once they have fallen, they steadily persist. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
original idea of the railroad train was a succession
of stage coaches chained together and hauled by a
locomotive. The famous pioneer train of August
9, 1831, over the Mohawk Valley road was literally
made up in this way, the bodies of stage
coaches having been placed on trucks, which "were
coupled together with chains or chain-links, leaving
from two to three feet slack, and when the locomotive
started it took up the slack by jerks, with
sufficient force to jerk the passengers, who sat on
seats across the tops of the coaches, out from under
their hats, and in stopping they came together with
such force as to send them flying from their seats."
On this trip, it will be remembered, the train presently
came to a stop, when the passengers upon it,
with true American adaptability, set their wits at
once to the work of devising some means of
remedying the unpleasant jerks.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> "A plan was
soon hit upon and put in execution. The three
links in the couplings of the cars were stretched to
their utmost tension, a rail, from a fence in the
neighborhood, was placed between each pair of
cars and made fast by means of the packing yarn
from the cylinders." Here was the incipient idea
of couplers and buffers improvised by practical
men, and for a third of a century it remained almost
unimproved upon, except by the introduction
of a spring upon which coupler and buffer played.
The only other considerable change made in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
earlier days of car construction was by no means
an improvement, inasmuch as it introduced the new
and wholly unnecessary danger of telescoping.</p>

<p>The original passenger cars, however frail and
light they may have been, were at least, when
shackled together in a train, continuous in their
bearings on each other,&mdash;that is, their sills and floor
timbers were all on a level and in line, so that, if the
cars were suddenly pressed together, they met in
such a way as to resist the pressure to the extent of
their resisting power, and the floor of one did not
quietly slide under or over that of another. The
bodies of these cars were about thirty-two inches
from the rails. This was presently found to be too
low. In raising the bodies of the cars, however,
the mechanics of those days encountered a practical
difficulty. The couplings of the cars built on
the new model were higher than those of the old.
They at once met, and, as they thought, no less
ingeniously then successfully overcame this difficulty,
by placing the couplings and draw-heads of
their new cars below the line of the sills. This
necessitated putting the platform which sustained
the coupling also beneath the sills, and in doing
that they disregarded, without the most remote
consciousness of the fact, a fundamental law of
mechanics. With a possible pressure, both sudden
and heavy to be resisted, the line of resistance was
no longer the line of greatest strength. During
thirty years this stupid blunder remained uncorrected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
It was as if the builders during that period
had from force of habit insisted upon always using
as supports pillars which were curved or bent
instead of upright. At the close of those thirty
years also the railroad mechanics had become so
thoroughly educated into their false methods that
it took yet other years and a series of frightful
disasters, the significance of which they seemed
utterly unable to take in, before they could be induced
to abandon those methods.</p>

<p>The two great dangers of telescoping and oscillation
were directly due to this system of car
construction and of train coupling,&mdash;and telescoping
and oscillation were probably the cause of one-half
at least of the loss of life and the injuries to
persons incident to the first thirty years of American
railroad experience. The badly built and
loosely connected coaches of every train going at
any considerable rate of speed used then to swing
and roll about and hammer against each other after
a fashion which made the infrequent occurrence of
serious disaster the only fair subject for surprise.
In case of a sudden stoppage or partial derailment,
the train stopped or went on, not as a whole, but as
a succession of parts, while the low platforms and
slack couplings fearfully increased the danger;&mdash;for,
if the train held together, the cars in stopping were
likely to break off the platforms, making of what
remained of them a sort of inclined plane over
which the car-bodies rode into each other at different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
levels; or, if the couplings, as was more
probable, held and the train did not part, the swaying
and swinging of the loosely connected cars was
almost sure to throw them from the track and
break them in pieces. The invention through
which this difficulty was at last overcome, simple
and obvious as it was, is fairly entitled, so far as
America at least is concerned, to be classed among
the four or five really noticeable advances which
have of late years been made in railroad appliances.
It contributed unmistakably and essentially to the
safety of every traveller. Known as the Miller
platform and buffer, from the name of the inventor,
it was, like all good work of the sort, a simple and
intelligent recurrence to correct mechanical principles.
Miller went to work to construct cars in
such a way as to cause them to come in contact
with each other in the line of their greatest resisting
power, while in coupling them together in trains
he introduced both tension and compression;&mdash;that
is he, in plain language, brought the ends of the
heavy longitudinal floor timbers of the separate
cars exactly on a line and directly bearing on each
other, and then forced them against each other
until the heavy spring buffers which played on
those floor timbers were compressed, when the
couplers sprung together and the train then stood
practically one solid body from end to end. It
could no more swing or crush than a single car
could swing or crush. It then only remained to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
increase the weight and to perfect the construction
of the vehicles to insure all the safety in this respect
of which travel by rail admitted.</p>

<p>Simple as these improvements were, and apparently
obvious as the mechanical principles on which
they were based now seem, the opposition for years
offered to them by practical master-mechanics and
railroad men would have been ludicrous had it not
been exasperating. There was hardly a railroad in
the country whose officers did not insist that their
method of construction was exceptional, it was
true, but far better than Miller's. It was maintained
that the slack couplings were necessary in
order to enable the locomotives to start the trains,&mdash;that
a train made up without the slack, on Miller's
plan, could not be set in motion, and that if it
was set in motion it must twist apart at every sharp
curve etc. The ingenuity displayed in thus inventing
theoretical objections to the appliance far exceeded
that required for inventing it, and indeed
no one who has not had official experience of it
can at all realize the objecting capacity of the
typical practical mechanic whose conceit as a rule
is measured by his ignorance, while his stupidity is
unequalled save by his obstinacy. Even when
Miller's invention for one reason or another was
not adopted, the principles upon which that invention
was founded,&mdash;the principles of tension,
cohesion and direct resistance,&mdash;at last forced their
way into general acceptance. The long-urged objection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
that the thing was practically impossible
was slowly abandoned in face of the awkward but
undeniable fact that it was done every day, and
many times a day. Consequently, as the result of
much patient arguing, duly emphasized by the
regular recurrence of disaster, it is not too much to
assert that for weight, resisting power, perfection of
construction and equipment and the protection
they afford to travellers, the standard American
passenger coach is now far in advance of any other.
As to comfort, convenience, taste in ornamentation,
etc., these are so much matters of habit and education
that it is unnecessary to discuss them. They
do not affect the question of safety.</p>

<p>A very striking illustration of the vast increase of
safety secured through this improved car construction
was furnished in an accident, which happened in
Massachusetts upon July 15, 1872. As an express
train on the Boston &amp; Providence road was that day
running to Boston about noon and at a rate of speed
of some forty miles an hour, it came in contact with
a horse and wagon at a grade crossing in the town
of Foxborough. The train was made up of thoroughly
well-built cars, equipped with both the Miller
platform and the Westinghouse train-brake. There
was no time in which to check the speed, and it thus
became a simple question of strength of construction,
to be tested in an unavoidable collision. The
engine struck the wagon, and instantly destroyed it.
The horse had already cleared the rails when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
wagon was struck, but, a portion of his harness getting
caught on the locomotive, he was thrown down
and dragged a short distance until his body came in
contact with the platform of a station close to the
spot of collision. The body was then forced under
the cars, having been almost instantaneously rolled
and pounded up into a hard, unyielding mass. The
results which ensued were certainly very singular.
Next to the locomotive was an ordinary baggage
and mail car, and it was under this car, and between
its forward and its hind truck, that the body of the
horse was forced; coming then directly in contact
with the truck of the rear wheels, it tore it from its
fastenings and thus let the rear end of the car drop
upon the track. In falling, this end snapped the
coupling by its weight, and so disconnected the
train, the locomotive going off towards Boston dragging
this single car, with one end of it bumping
along the track. Meanwhile the succeeding car of
the train had swept over the body of the horse and
the disconnected truck, which were thus brought in
contact with its own wheels, which in their turn
were also torn off; and so great was the momentum
that in this way all of the four passenger cars which
composed that part of the train were successively
driven clean off their rolling gear, and not only did
they then slide off the track, but they crossed a railroad
siding which happened to be at that point,
went down an embankment three or four feet in
height, demolished a fence, passed into an adjoining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
field, and then at last, after glancing from the stump
of a large oak-tree, they finally came to a stand-still
some two hundred feet from the point at which they
had left the track. There was not in this case even
an approach to telescoping; on the contrary, each car
rested perfectly firmly in its place as regarded all the
others, not a person was injured, and when the wheel-less
train at last became stationary the astonished
passengers got up and hurried through the doors,
the very glass in which as well as that in the windows
was unbroken. Here was an indisputable
victory of skill and science over accident, showing
most vividly to what an infinitesimal extreme the
dangers incident to telescoping may be reduced.</p>

<p>The vast progress in this direction made within
twenty years can, however, best perhaps be illustrated
by the results of two accidents almost precisely similar
in character, which occurred, the one on the Great
Western railroad of Canada, in October, 1854, the
other on the Boston &amp; Albany, in Massachusetts, in
October, 1874. In the first case a regular train made
up of a locomotive and seven cars, while approaching
Detroit at a speed of some twenty miles an hour,
ran into a gravel train of fifteen cars which was
backing towards it at a speed of some ten miles an
hour. The locomotive of the passenger train was
thrown completely off the track and down the embankment,
dragging after it a baggage car. At the
head of the passenger portion of the train were two
second-class cars filled with emigrants; both of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
were telescoped and demolished, and all their unfortunate
occupants either killed or injured. The
front of the succeeding first-class car was then crushed
in, and a number of those in it were hurt. In all, no
less than forty-seven persons lost their lives, while
sixty others were maimed or severely bruised. So
much for a collision in October, 1854. In October,
1874, on the Boston &amp; Albany road, the regular New
York express train, consisting of a locomotive and
seven cars, while going during the night at a speed
of forty miles an hour, was suddenly, near the Brimfield
station, thrown by a misplaced switch into a
siding upon which a number of platform freight cars
were standing. The train was thoroughly equipped,
having both Miller platform and Westinghouse brake.
The six seconds which intervened, in the darkness,
between notice of displacement and the collision did
not enable the engineer to check perceptibly the
speed of his train, and when the blow came it was a
simple question of strength to resist. The shock
must have been tremendous, for the locomotive and
tender were flung off the track to the right and the
baggage car to the left, the last being thrown across
the interval between the siding and the main track
and resting obliquely over the latter. The forward
end of the first passenger coach was thrown beyond
the baggage car up over the tender, and its rear
end, as well as the forward end of the succeeding
coach, was injured. As in the Foxborough case,
several of the trucks were jerked out from under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the cars to which they belonged, but not a person
on the train was more than slightly bruised, the
cars were not disconnected, nor was there even
a suggestion of telescoping.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>THE VERSAILLES ACCIDENT.</h3>


<p>Going back once more to the early days, a third
of a century since, before yet the periodical recurrence
of slaughter had caused either train-brake or
Miller platform to be imagined as possibilities, before,
indeed, there was yet any record of what we
would now consider a regular railroad field-day, with
its long train of accompanying horrors, including in
the grisly array death by crushing, scalding, drowning,
burning, and impalement,&mdash;going back to the
year 1840, or thereabouts, we find that the railroad
companies experienced a notable illustration of the
truth of the ancient adage that it never rains but it
pours; for it was then that the long immunity was
rudely broken in upon. After that time disasters
on the rail seemed to tread upon one another's heels
in quick and frightful succession. Within a few
months of the English catastrophe of December
24, 1841, there happened in France one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
famous and most horrible railroad slaughters ever
recorded. It took place on the 8th of May, 1842.
It was the birthday of the king, Louis Philippe, and,
in accordance with the usual practice, the occasion
had been celebrated at Versailles by a great display
of the fountains. At half past five o'clock these had
stopped playing, and a general rush ensued for the
trains then about to leave for Paris. That which
went by the road along the left bank of the Seine
was densely crowded, and so long that two locomotives
were required to draw it. As it was moving
at a high rate of speed between Bellevue and
Meudon, the axle of the foremost of these two locomotives
broke, letting the body of the engine drop
to the ground. It instantly stopped, and the second
locomotive was then driven by its impetus on top of
the first, crushing its engineer and fireman, while the
contents of both the fire-boxes were scattered over
the roadway and among the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i>. Three carriages
crowded with passengers were then piled on top of
this burning mass and there crushed together into
each other. The doors of these carriages were
locked, as was then and indeed is still the custom
in Europe, and it so chanced that they had all been
newly painted. They blazed up like pine kindlings.
Some of the carriages were so shattered that a portion
of those in them were enabled to extricate themselves,
but the very much larger number were held
fast; and of these such as were not so fortunate as to
be crushed to death in the first shock perished hopelessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
in the flames before the eyes of a throng of
lookers-on impotent to aid. Fifty-two or fifty-three
persons were supposed to have lost their lives in
this disaster, and more than forty others were injured;
the exact number of the killed, however,
could never be ascertained, as the piling-up of the
cars on top of the two locomotives had made of
the destroyed portion of the train a veritable holocaust
of the most hideous description. Not only
did whole families perish together,&mdash;in one case no
less than eleven members of the same family sharing
a common fate,&mdash;but the remains of such as
were destroyed could neither be identified nor separated.
In one case a female foot was alone recognizable,
while in others the bodies were calcined and
and fused into an indistinguishable mass. The
Academy of Sciences appointed a committee to inquire
whether Admiral D'Urville, a distinguished
French navigator, was among the victims. His
body was thought to be found, but it was so terribly
mutilated that it could be recognized only by a
sculptor, who chanced some time before to have
taken a phrenological cast of the skull. His wife
and only son had perished with him.</p>

<p>It is not easy now to conceive the excitement and
dismay which this catastrophe caused throughout
France. The railroad was at once associated in
the minds of an excitable people with novel forms
of imminent death. France had at best been laggard
enough in its adoption of the new invention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and now it seemed for a time as if the Versailles disaster
was to operate as a barrier in the way of all
further railroad development. Persons availed themselves
of the steam roads already constructed as
rarely as possible, and then in fear and trembling,
while steps were taken to substitute horse for steam
power on other roads then in process of construction.</p>

<p>The disaster was, indeed, one well calculated to
make a deep impression on the popular mind, for it
lacked almost no attribute of the dramatic and terrible.
There were circumstances connected with it,
too, which gave it a sort of moral significance,&mdash;contrasting
so suddenly the joyous return from the
country <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> in the pleasant afternoon of May, with
what De Quincey has called the vision of sudden
death. It contained a whole homily on the familiar
text. As respects the number of those killed and
injured, also, the Versailles accident has not often
been surpassed; perhaps never in France. In this
country it was surpassed on one occasion, among
others, under circumstances very similar to it.
This was the accident at Camphill station, about
twelve miles from Philadelphia, on July 17, 1856,
which befell an excursion train carrying some eleven
hundred children, who had gone out on a Sunday-school
picnic in charge of their teachers and friends.</p>

<p>It was the usual story. The road had but a single
track, and the train, both long and heavy, had been
delayed and was running behind its schedule time.
The conductor thought, however, that the next station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
could yet be reached in time to meet and there
pass a regular train coming towards him. It may
have been a miscalculation of seconds, it may have
been a difference of watches, or perhaps the regular
train was slightly before its time; but, however it
happened, as the excursion train, while running at
speed, was rounding a reverse curve, it came full
upon the regular train, which had just left the station.
In those days, as compared with the present,
the cars were but egg-shells, and the shock was terrific.
The locomotives struck each other, and, after
rearing themselves up for an instant, it is said, like
living animals, fell to the ground mere masses of
rubbish. In any case the force of the shock was
sufficient to hurl both engines from the track and lay
them side by side at right angles to, and some distance
from it. As only the excursion train happened
to be running at speed, it alone had all the impetus
necessary for telescoping; three of its cars accordingly
closed in upon each other, and the children in
them were crushed; as in the Versailles accident,
two succeeding cars were driven upon this mass,
and then fire was set to the whole from the ruins
of the locomotives. It would be hard to imagine
anything more thoroughly heart-rending, for the
holocaust was of little children on a party of pleasure.
Five cars in all were burned, and sixty-six
persons perished; the injured numbered more than
a hundred.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<p>Of this disaster nothing could be said either in
excuse or in extenuation; it was not only one of
the worst description, but it was one of that description
the occurrence of which is most frequent.
An excursion train, while running against time on a
single-track road, came in collision with a regular
train. The record is full of similar disasters, too
numerous to admit of specific reference. Primarily
of course, the conductors of the special trains are as
a rule in fault in such cases. He certainly was at
Camphill, and felt himself to be so, for the next day
he committed suicide by swallowing arsenic. But
in reality in these and in all similar cases,&mdash;both
those which have happened and those hereafter
surely destined to happen,&mdash;the full responsibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
does not rest upon the unfortunate or careless subordinate;&mdash;nor
should the weight of punishment
be visited upon him. It belongs elsewhere. At this
late day no board of directors, nor president, nor
superintendent has any right to operate a single
track road without the systematic use of the telegraph
in connection with its train movements.
That the telegraph can be used to block, as it
is termed, double-track roads, by dividing them
into sections upon no one of which two trains can
be running at the same time, is matter of long and
daily experience. There is nothing new or experimental
about it. It is a system which has been
forced on the more crowded lines of the world as an
alternative to perennial killings. That in the year
1879 excursion trains should rush along single-track
roads and hurl themselves against regular trains,
just as was done twenty-three years ago at Camphill,
would be deemed incredible were not exactly similar
accidents still from time to time reported. One
occurred near St. Louis, for instance, on July 4,
1879. The simple fact is that to now operate single-track
roads without the constant aid of the telegraph,
as a means of blocking them for every irregular
train, indicates a degree of wanton carelessness,
or an excess of incompetence, for which adequate
provision should be made in the criminal
law. Nothing but this appeal to the whipping-post,
as it were, seems to produce the needed
mental activity; for it is difficult to realize the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
stupid conservatism of ordinary men when brought
to the consideration of something to which they
are not accustomed. On this very point of controlling
the train movement of single-track roads by
telegraph, for instance, within a very recent period
the superintendent of a leading Massachusetts road
gravely assured the railroad commissioners of that
state, that he considered it a most dangerous reliance
which had occasioned many disasters, and that
he had no doubt it would be speedily abandoned
as a practice in favor of the old time-table and
running-rules system, from which no deviations
would be allowed. This opinion was expressed,
also, after the Revere disaster of 1871, it might
have been supposed, had branded into the record of
the state the impossibility of safely running any
crowded railroad in a reliance upon the schedule.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Such men as this, however, are not accessible to
argument or the teachings of experience, and the
gentle stimulant of a criminal prosecution seems
to be the only thing left.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>TELEGRAPHIC COLLISIONS.</h3>


<p>And yet, even with the wires in active use, collisions
will occasionally take place. They have
sometimes, indeed, even been caused by the telegraph,
so that railroad officials at two adjacent stations
on the same road, having launched trains at
each other beyond recall, have busied themselves
while waiting for tidings of the inevitable collision
in summoning medical assistance for those sure soon
to be injured. In such cases, however, the mishap
can almost invariably be traced to some defect in the
system under which the telegraph is used;&mdash;such as
a neglect to exact return messages to insure accuracy,
or the delegating to inexperienced subordinates
the work which can be properly performed only by
a principal. This was singularly illustrated in a terrible
collision which took place at Thorpe, between
Norwich and Great Yarmouth, on the Great Eastern
Railway in England, on the 10th of September,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
1874. The line had in this place but a single track,
and the mail train to Norwich, under the rule, had
to wait at a station called Brundell until the arrival
there of the evening express from Yarmouth, or until
it received permission by the telegraph to proceed.
On the evening of the disaster the express
train was somewhat behind its time, and the inspector
wrote a dispatch directing the mail to come
forward without waiting for it. This dispatch he
left in the telegraph office unsigned, while he went
to attend to other matters. Just then the express
train came along, and he at once allowed it to proceed.
Hardly was it under way when the unsigned
dispatch occurred to him, and the unfortunate man
dashed to the telegraph office only to learn that the
operator had forwarded it. Under the rules of the
company no return message was required. A second
dispatch was instantly sent to Brundell to stop the
mail; the reply came back that the mail was gone.
A collision was inevitable.</p>

<p>The two trains were of very equal weight, the
one consisting of fourteen and the other of thirteen
carriages. They were both drawn by powerful
locomotives, the drivers of which had reason for
putting on an increased speed, believing, as each had
cause to believe, that the other was waiting for him.
The night was intensely dark and it was raining
heavily, so that, even if the brakes were applied, the
wheels would slide along the slippery track. Under
these circumstances the two trains rushed upon each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
other around a slight curve which sufficed to conceal
their head-lights. The combined momentum must
have amounted to little less than sixty miles an hour,
and the shock was heard through all the neighboring
village. The smoke-stack of the locomotive drawing
the mail train was swept away as the other locomotive
seemed to rush on top of it, while the carriages
of both trains followed until a mound of
locomotives and shattered cars was formed which
the descending torrents alone hindered from becoming
a funeral pyre. So sudden was the collision
that the driver of one of the engines did not apparently
have an opportunity to shut off the steam,
and his locomotive, though forced from the track
and disabled, yet remained some time in operation
in the midst of the wreck. In both trains, very fortunately,
there were a number of empty cars between
the locomotives and the carriages in which the passengers
were seated, and they were utterly demolished;
but for this fortunate circumstance the
Thorpe collision might well have proved the most
disastrous of all railroad accidents. As it was, the
men on both the locomotives were instantly killed,
together with seventeen passengers, and four other
passengers subsequently died of their injuries; making
a total of twenty-five deaths, besides fifty cases
of injury.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to conceive of a more violent
collision than that which has just been described;
and yet, as curiously illustrating the rapidity with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
which the force of the most severe shock is expended,
it is said that two gentlemen in the last
carriage of one of the trains, finding it at a sudden
standstill close to the place to which they were going,
supposed it had stopped for some unimportant cause
and concluded to take advantage of a happy chance
which left them almost at the doors of their homes.
They accordingly got out and hurried away in the
rain, learning only the next morning of the catastrophe
in which they had been unconscious participants.</p>

<p>The collision at Thorpe occurred in September,
1874. Seven months later, on the 4th of April,
1875, there was an accident similar to it in almost
every respect, except fatality, on the Burlington
&amp; Missouri road in Iowa. In this case the operator
at Tyrone had telegraphic orders to hold the
east-bound passenger express at that point to meet
the west-bound passenger express. This order
he failed to deliver, and the train accordingly at
once went on to the usual passing place at the
next station. It was midnight and intensely dark,
with a heavy mist in the air which at times thickened
to rain. Both of the trains approaching each
other were made up in the way usual with through
night trains on the great western lines, and consisted
of locomotives, baggage and smoking cars,
behind which were the ordinary passenger cars of
the company followed by several heavy Pullman
sleeping coaches. Those in charge of the east-bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
train, knowing that it was behind time, were running
it rapidly, so as to delay as little as possible the
west-bound train, which, having received the order
to pass at Tyrone was itself being run at speed.
Both trains were thus moving at some thirty-five
miles an hour, when suddenly in rounding a sharp
curve they came upon each other. Indeed so close
were they that the west-bound engineer had no time
in which to reverse, but, jumping straight from the
gangway, he afterwards declared that the locomotives
came together before he reached the ground.
The engineer of the east-bound train succeeded both
in reversing his locomotive and in applying his airbrake,
but after reversal the throttle flew open. The
trains came together, therefore, as at Thorpe, with
their momentum practically unchecked, and with
such force that the locomotives were completely
demolished, the boilers of the two, though on the
same line of rails, actually, in some way, passing
each other. The baggage-cars were also destroyed,
and the smoking cars immediately behind them were
more or less damaged, but the remaining coaches
of each train stood upon the tracks so wholly uninjured
that four hours later, other locomotives having
been procured but the track being still blocked,
the passengers were transferred from one set of cars
to the other, and in them were carried to their destinations.
So admirably did Miller's construction
serve its purpose in this case, that, while the superintendent
of the road, who happened to be in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
rear sleeping car of one of the trains, merely reported
that he "felt the shock quite sensibly," passengers
in the rear coaches of the other train hardly
felt it at all.</p>

<p>At Tyrone the wrecks of the trains caught fire
from the stoves thrown out of the baggage cars and
from the embers from the fire-boxes of the locomotives,
but the flames were speedily extinguished.
Of the train hands three were killed and two injured,
but no passenger was more than shaken or
slightly bruised. This was solely due to strength
of car construction. Heavy as the shock was,&mdash;so
heavy that in the similar case at Thorpe the carriages
were crushed like nut-shells under it,&mdash;the
resisting power was equal to it. The failure of appliances
at one point in the operation of the road
was made good by their perfection at another.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>OIL-TANK ACCIDENTS.</h3>


<p>Similar in some of its more dramatic features to
the Versailles accident, though originating from a
wholly different cause, was the Abergele disaster,
which at the time occupied the attention of the
British public to the exclusion of everything else.
It occurred in 1868, and to the "Irish mail," perhaps
the most famous train which is run in England,
if, indeed, not in the world. Leaving London shortly
after 7 <small>A.M.</small>, the Irish mail was then timed to make
the distance to Chester, 166 miles, in four hours and
eighteen minutes, or at the rate of 40 miles an hour.
For the next 85 miles, completing the run to Holyhead,
the speed was somewhat increased, two hours
and five minutes only being allowed for it. Abergele
is a point on the sea-coast of Wales, nearly
midway between Chester and Holyhead. On the
day of the accident, August 20, 1868, the Irish
mail left Chester as usual. It was made up of thirteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
carriages in all, which were occupied, as the
carriages of that train usually were, by a large number
of persons whose names at least were widely
known. Among these, on this particular occasion,
was the Duchess of Abercorn, wife of the then Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland, with five children. Under the
running arrangements of the London &amp; North Western
road a freight, or as it is there called a goods
train, left Chester half an hour before the mail, and
was placed upon the siding at Llanddulas, a station
about a mile and a half beyond Abergele, to allow
the mail to pass. From Abergele to Llanddulas the
track ascended by a gradient of some sixty feet to
the mile. On the day of the accident it chanced
that certain wagons between the engine and the
rear end of the goods train had to be taken out to
be left at Llanddulas, and in doing this it became
necessary to separate the train and to leave five or
six of the last wagons in it standing on the tracks of
the main line, while those which were to be left
were backed onto a siding. The employé, whose
duty it was, neglected to set the brakes on the
wagons thus left standing, and consequently when
the engine and the rest of the train returned
for them, the moment they were touched and before
a coupling could be effected, the jar set them
in motion down the incline towards Abergele. They
started so slowly that a brakeman of the train ran
after them, fully expecting to catch and stop them,
but as they went down the grade they soon outstripped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
him and it became clear that there was
nothing to check them until they should meet the
Irish mail, then almost due. It also chanced that
the cars thus set in motion were oil cars.</p>

<p>The track of the North Western road between
Abergele and Llanddulas runs along the sides of the
picturesque Welsh hills, which rise up to the south,
while to the north there stretches out a wide expanse
of sea. The mail train was skirting the hills
and laboring up the grade at a speed of thirty miles
an hour, when its engineer suddenly became aware
of the loose wagons coming down upon it around
the curve, and then but a few yards off. Seeing
that they were oil cars he almost instinctively
sprang from his locomotive, and was thrown down
by the impetus and rolled to the side of the road-bed.
Picking himself up, bruised but not seriously
hurt, he saw that the collision had already taken
place, that the tender had ridden directly over the
engine, that the colliding cars were demolished, and
that the foremost carriages of the train were already
on fire. Running quickly to the rear of the train
he succeeded in uncoupling six carriages and a van,
which were drawn away from the rest, before the
flames extended to them, by an engine which most
fortunately was following the train. All the other
carriages were utterly destroyed, and every person
in them perished.</p>

<p>The Abergele was probably the solitary instance
of a railroad accident in which but a single survivor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
sustained any injury. There was no maiming.
It was death or entire escape. The collision
was not a particularly severe one, and the engineer
of the mail train especially stated that at the moment
it occurred the loose cars were still moving
so slowly that he would not have sprung from his
engine had he not seen that they were loaded with
oil. The very instant the collision took place, however,
the fluid seemed to ignite and to flash along
the train like lightning, so that it was impossible to
approach a carriage when once it caught fire. The
fact was that the oil in vast quantities was spilled
upon the track and ignited by the fire of the locomotive,
and then the impetus of the mail train forced
all of its leading carriages into the dense mass of
smoke and flame. All those who were present concurred
in positively stating that not a cry, nor a
moan, nor a sound of any description was heard
from the burning carriages, nor did any one in them
apparently make an effort to escape.</p>

<p>The most graphic description of this extraordinary
and terrible catastrophe was that given by the
Marquis of Hamilton, the eldest son of the Duke of
Abercorn whose wife and family, fortunately for
themselves, occupied one of those rear carriages
which were unshackled and saved. In this account
the Marquis of Hamilton said:&mdash;"We were startled
by a collision and a shock which, though not very
severe, were sufficient to throw every one against
his opposite neighbor. I immediately jumped out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of the carriage, when a fearful sight met my view.
Already the whole of the three passengers' carriages
in front of ours, the vans, and the engine were enveloped
in dense sheets of flame and smoke, rising
fully twenty feet high, and spreading out in every
direction. It was the work of an instant. No words
can convey the instantaneous nature of the explosion
and conflagration. I had actually got out almost
before the shock of the collision was over, and
this was the spectacle which already presented itself.
Not a sound, not a scream, not a struggle to escape,
not a movement of any sort was apparent in the
doomed carriages. It was as though an electric
flash had at once paralyzed and stricken every one
of their occupants. So complete was the absence of
any presence of living or struggling life in them that
as soon as the passengers from the other parts of
the train were in some degree recovered from their
first shock and consternation, it was imagined that
the burning carriages were destitute of passengers;
a hope soon changed into feelings of horror when
their contents of charred and mutilated remains were
discovered an hour afterward. From the extent,
however, of the flames, the suddenness of the conflagration,
and the absence of any power to extricate
themselves, no human aid would have been of any
assistance to the sufferers, who, in all probability,
were instantaneously suffocated by the black and
fetid smoke peculiar to paraffine, which rose in volumes
around the spreading flames."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the collision took place before one o'clock,
in spite of the efforts of a large gang of men who
were kept throwing water on the tracks, the perfect
sea of flame which covered the line for a distance of
some forty or fifty yards could not be extinguished
until nearly eight o'clock in the evening; for the
petroleum had flowed down into the ballasting of
the road, and the rails themselves were red-hot. It
was therefore small occasion for surprise that, when
the fire was at last gotten under, the remains of
those who lost their lives were in some cases wholly
undistinguishable, and in others almost so. Among
the thirty-three victims of the disaster the body of
no single one retained any traces of individuality;
the faces of all were wholly destroyed, and in no
case were there found feet, or legs, or anything at
all approaching to a perfect head. Ten corpses
were finally identified as those of males, and thirteen
as those of females, while the sex of ten others
could not be determined. The body of one passenger,
Lord Farnham, was identified by the crest
on his watch; and, indeed, no better evidence of
the wealth and social position of the victims of this
accident could have been asked for than the collection
of articles found on its site. It included diamonds
of great size and singular brilliancy; rubies,
opals, emeralds, gold tops of smelling-bottles,
twenty-four watches, of which but two or three
were not gold, chains, clasps of bags, and very
many bundles of keys. Of these the diamonds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
alone had successfully resisted the intense heat of
the flame; the settings were nearly all destroyed.</p>

<p>Of the causes of this accident little need or can
be said. No human appliances, no more ingenious
brakes or increased strength of construction, could
have averted it or warded off its consequences once
it was inevitable. It was occasioned primarily by
two things, the most dangerous and the most difficult
to reach of all the many sources of danger
against which those managing railroads have unsleepingly
to contend:&mdash;a somewhat defective discipline,
aggravated by a little not unnatural carelessness.
The rule of the company was specific
that all the wagons of every goods train should be
out of the way and the track clear at least ten
minutes before a passenger train was due; but in
this case shunting was going actively on when the
Irish-mail was within a mile and a half. A careless
brakeman then forgot for once that he was leaving
his wagons close to the head of an incline; a blow
in coupling, a little heavier perhaps than usual,
sufficed to set them in motion; and they happened
to be loaded with oil.</p>

<p>A catastrophe strikingly similar to that at Abergele
befell an express train on the Hudson River
railroad, upon the night of the 6th of February,
1871. The weather for a number of days preceding
the accident had been unusually cold, and it is to
the suffering of employés incident to exposure, and
the consequent neglect of precautions on their part,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that accidents are peculiarly due. On this night a
freight train was going south, all those in charge of
which were sheltering themselves during a steady
run in the caboose car at its rear end. Suddenly,
when near a bridge over Wappinger's Creek, not far
from New Hamburg, they discovered that a car in
the centre of the train was off the track. The train
was finally stopped on the bridge, but in stopping it
other cars were also derailed, and one of these, bearing
on it two large oil tanks, finally rested obliquely
across the bridge with one end projecting over the up
track. Hardly had the disabled train been brought
to a stand-still, when, before signal lanterns could in
the confusion incident to the disaster be sent out,
the Pacific express from New York, which was a
little behind its time, came rapidly along. As it
approached the bridge, its engineer saw a red lantern
swung, and instantly gave the signal to apply
the brakes. It was too late to avoid the collision;
but what ensued had in it, so far as the engineer
was concerned, an element of the heroic, which
his companion, the fireman of the engine, afterwards
described on the witness stand with a directness
and simplicity of language which exceeded all
art. The engineer's name was Simmons, and he
was familiarly known among his companions as
"Doc." His fireman, Nicholas Tallon, also saw the
red light swung on the bridge, and called out to him
that the draw was open. In reply Simmons told
him to spring the patent brake, which he did, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
by this time they were alongside of the locomotive
of the disabled train and running with a somewhat
slackened speed. Tallon had now got out upon the
step of the locomotive, preparatory to springing off,
and turning asked his companion if he also proposed
to do the same:&mdash;"'Doc' looked around at me
but made no reply, and then looked ahead again,
watching his business; then I jumped and rolled
down on the ice in the creek; the next I knew I
heard the crash and saw the fire and smoke." The
next seen of "Doc" Simmons, he was dragged up
days afterwards from under his locomotive at the
bottom of the river. But it was a good way to die.
He went out of the world and of the sight of men
with his hand on the lever, making no reply to the
suggestion that he should leave his post, but "looking
ahead and watching his business."</p>

<p>Dante himself could not have imagined a greater
complication of horrors than then ensued: liquid
fire and solid frost combined to make the work of
destruction perfect. The shock of the collision
broke in pieces the oil car, igniting its contents and
flinging them about in every direction. In an instant
bridge, river, locomotive, cars, and the glittering
surface of the ice were wrapped in a sheet of
flame. At the same time the strain proved too severe
for the trestlework, which gave way, precipitating
the locomotive, tender, baggage cars, and one
passenger car onto the ice, through which they instantly
crushed and sank deep out of sight beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the water. Of the remaining seven cars of the passenger
train, two, besides several of the freight train,
were destroyed by fire, and shortly, as the supports
of the remaining portions of the bridge burned
away, the superstructure fell on the half-submerged
cars in the water and buried them from view.</p>

<p>Twenty-one persons lost their lives in this disaster,
and a large number of others were injured; but the
loss of life, it will be noticed, was only two-thirds of
that at Abergele. The New Hamburg catastrophe
also differed from that at Abergele in that, under its
particular circumstances, it was far more preventable,
and, indeed, with the appliances since brought
into use it would surely be avoided. The modern
train-brake had, however, not then been perfected,
so that even the hundred rods at which the signal
was seen did not afford a sufficient space in which to
stop the train.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>DRAW-BRIDGE DISASTERS.</h3>


<p>It is difficult to see how on double track roads,
where the occurrence of an accident on one line of
tracks is always liable to instantly "foul" the other
line, it is possible to guard against contingencies
like that which occurred at New Hamburg. At the
time, as is usual in such cases, the public indignation
expended itself in vague denunciation of the Hudson
River Railroad Company, because the disaster happened
to take place upon a bridge in which there
was a draw to permit the passage of vessels. There
seemed to be a vague but very general impression
that draw-bridges were dangerous things, and, because
other accidents due to different causes had
happened upon them, that the occurrence of this
accident, from whatever cause, was in itself sufficient
evidence of gross carelessness. The fact was that
not even the clumsy Connecticut rule, which compels
the stopping of all trains before entering on any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
draw-bridge, would have sufficed to avert the New
Hamburg disaster, for the river was then frozen and
the draw was not in use, so that for the time being
the bridge was an ordinary bridge; and not even in
the frenzy of crude suggestions which invariably
succeeds each new accident was any one ever found
ignorant enough to suggest the stopping of all trains
before entering upon every bridge, which, as railroads
generally follow water-courses, would not infrequently
necessitate an average of one stop to
every thousand feet or so. Only incidentally did the
bridge at New Hamburg have anything to do with
the disaster there, the essence of which lay in the
sudden derailment of an oil car immediately in front
of a passenger train running in the opposite direction
and on the other track. Of course, if the derailment
had occurred long enough before the passenger train
came up to allow the proper signals to be given, and
this precaution had been neglected, then the disaster
would have been due, not to the original cause, but
to the defective discipline of the employés. Such
does not appear to have been the case at New Hamburg,
nor was that disaster by any means the first
due to derailment and the throwing of cars from one
track in front of a train passing upon the other;&mdash;nor
will it be the last. Indeed, an accident hardly
less destructive, arising from that very cause, had
occurred only eight months previous in England,
and resulted in eighteen deaths and more than fifty
cases of injury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>A goods train made up of a locomotive and
twenty-nine wagons was running at a speed of some
twenty miles an hour on the Great Northern road,
between Newark and Claypole, about one hundred
miles from London, when the forward axle under
one of the wagons broke. As a result of the derailment
which ensued the train became divided, and
presently the disabled car was driven by the pressure
behind it out of its course and over the interval, so
that it finally rested partly across the other track.
At just this moment an excursion train from London,
made up of twenty-three carriages and containing
some three hundred and forty passengers, came
along at a speed of about thirty-five miles an hour.
It was quite dark, and the engineer of the freight
train waved his arm as a signal of danger; one of
the guards, also, showed a red light with his hand
lantern, but his action either was not seen or was
misunderstood, for without any reduction of speed
being made the engine of the excursion train
plunged headlong into the disabled goods wagon.
The collision was so violent as to turn the engine
aside off the track and cause it to strike the stone
pier of a bridge near by, by which it was flung completely
around and then driven up the slope of
the cutting, where it toppled over like a rearing
horse and fell back into the roadway. The
tender likewise was overturned; but not so the
carriages. They rushed along holding to the track,
and the side of each as it passed was ripped and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
torn by the projecting end of the goods wagon. Of
the twenty-three carriages and vans in the train
scarcely one escaped damage, while the more forward
ones were in several cases lifted one on top of
the other or forced partly up the slope of the cutting,
whence they fell back again, crushing the passengers
beneath them.</p>

<p>This accident occurred on the 21st of June, 1870;
it was very thoroughly investigated by Captain
Tyler on behalf of the Board of Trade, with the apparent
conclusion that it was one which could hardly
have been guarded against. The freight cars, the
broken axle of which occasioned the disaster, did not
belong to the Great Northern company, and the
wheels of the train had been properly examined by
viewing and tapping at the several stopping-places;
the flaw which led to the fracture was, however, of
such a nature that it could have been detected only
by the removal of the wheel. It did not appear
that the employés of the company had been guilty
of any negligence; and it was difficult to avoid the
conclusion that the accident was due to one of those
defects to which the results of even the most perfect
human workmanship must ever remain liable,
and this had revealed itself under exactly those conditions
which must involve the most disastrous consequences.</p>

<p>The English accident did, however, establish one
thing, if nothing else; it showed the immeasurable
superiority of the system of investigation pursued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
in the case of railroad accidents in England over
that pursued in this country. There a trained expert
after the occurrence of each disaster visits the
spot and sifts the affair to the very bottom, locating
responsibility and pointing out distinctly the measures
necessary to guard against its repetition. Here
the case ordinarily goes to a coroner's jury, the
findings of which as a rule admirably sustain the
ancient reputation of that august tribunal. It is
absolutely sad to follow the course of these investigations,
they are conducted with such an entire
disregard of method and lead to such inadequate
conclusions. Indeed, how could it be otherwise?&mdash;The
same man never investigates two accidents,
and, for the one investigation he does make,
he is competent only in his own esteem.</p>

<p>Take the New Hamburgh accident as an example.
Rarely has any catastrophe merited a more careful
investigation, and few indeed have ever called forth
more ill-considered criticism or crude suggestions.
Almost nothing of interest respecting it was elicited
at the inquest, and now no reliable criticism can be
ventured upon it. The question of responsibility in
that case, and of prevention thereafter, involved
careful inquiry into at least four subjects:&mdash;First,
the ownership and condition of the freight car, the
fractured axle of which occasioned the disaster, together
with the precautions taken by the company,
usually and in this particular case, to test the
wheels of freight cars moving over its road, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
during times of severe cold.&mdash;Second, the
conduct of those in charge of the freight train immediately
preceding and at the time of the accident;
was the fracture of the axle at once noticed and
were measures taken to stop the train, or was the
derailment aggravated by neglect into the form it
finally took?&mdash;Third, was there any neglect in signaling
the accident on the part of those in charge of
the disabled train, and how much time elapsed between
the accident and the collision?&mdash;Fourth,
what, if any, improved appliances would have enabled
those in charge of either train to have averted
the accident?&mdash;and what, if any, defects either in the
rules or the equipment in use were revealed?</p>

<p>No satisfactory conclusion can now be arrived at
upon any of these points, though the probabilities
are that with the appliances since introduced the
train might have been stopped in time. In this case,
as in that at Claybridge, the coroner's jury returned
a verdict exonerating every one concerned from responsibility,
and very possibly they were justified in
so doing; though it is extremely questionable
whether Captain Tyler would have arrived at a similar
conclusion. There is a strong probability that
the investigation went off, so to speak, on a wholly
false issue,&mdash;turned on the draw-bridge frenzy instead
of upon the question of care. So far as the
verdict declared that the disaster was due to a collision
between a passenger train and a derailed oil
car, and not to the existence of a draw in the bridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
on which it happened to occur, it was, indeed, entitled
to respect, and yet it was on this very point
that it excited the most criticism. Loud commendation
was heard through the press of the Connecticut
law, which had been in force for twenty
years, and, indeed, still is in force there, under which
all trains are compelled to come to a full stop before
entering on any bridge which has a draw in it,&mdash;a
law which may best be described as a useless nuisance.
Yet the grand jury of the Court of Oyer
and Terminer of New York city even went so far as
to recommend, in a report made by it on the 23d of
February, 1871,&mdash;sixteen days after the accident,&mdash;the
passage by the legislature then in session at Albany
of a similar legal absurdity. Fortunately better
counsels prevailed, and, as the public recovered
its equilibrium, the matter was allowed to drop.</p>

<p>The Connecticut law in question, however, originated
in an accident which at the time had startled
and shocked the community as much even as that at
Versailles did before or that at Abergele has since
done. It occurred to an express train on the New
York &amp; New Haven road at Norwalk, in Connecticut,
on the 6th of May, 1853.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>THE NORWALK ACCIDENT.</h3>


<p>The railroad at Norwalk crosses a small inlet of
Long Island Sound by means of a draw-bridge, which
is approached from the direction of New York around
a sharp curve. A ball at the mast-head was in 1853
the signal that the draw was open and the bridge
closed to the passage of trains. The express passenger
train for Boston, consisting of a locomotive and
two baggage and five passenger cars, containing about
one hundred and fifty persons, left New York as usual
at eight o'clock that morning. The locomotive was
not in charge of its usual engine-driver but of a
substitute named Tucker; a man who some seven
years before had been injured in a previous collision
on the same road, for which he did not appear to
have been in any way responsible, but who had then
given up his position and gone to California, whence
he had recently returned and was now again an applicant
for an engineer's situation. This was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
third trip over the road, as substitute. In approaching
the bridge at Norwalk he apparently wholly neglected
to look for the draw-signal. He was running
his train at about the usual rate of speed, and first
became aware that the draw was open when within
four hundred feet of it and after it had become
wholly impossible to stop the train in time. He immediately
whistled for brakes and reversed his engine,
and then, without setting the brake on his tender,
both he and the fireman sprang off and escaped with
trifling injuries. The train at this time did not appear
to be moving at a speed of over fifteen miles an
hour. The draw was sixty feet in width; the water
in the then state of the tide was about twelve feet
deep, and the same distance below the level of the
bridge. Although the speed of the train had been
materially reduced, yet when it came to the opening
it was still moving with sufficient impetus to send
its locomotive clean across the sixty foot interval
and to cause it to strike the opposite abutment
about eight feet below the track; it then fell
heavily to the bottom. The tender lodged on
top of the locomotive, bottom up and resting
against the pier, while on top of this again was
the first baggage car. The second baggage car,
which contained also a compartment for smokers,
followed, but in falling was canted over to the
north side of the draw in such a way as not to be
wholly submerged, so that most of those in it were
saved. The first passenger car next plunged into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the opening; its forward end crushed in, as it fell
against the baggage car in front of it, while its rear
end dropped into the deep water below; and on top
of it came the second passenger car, burying the
passengers in the first beneath the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i>, and itself
partially submerged. The succeeding or third passenger
car, instead of following the others, broke in
two in the middle, the forward part hanging down
over the edge of the draw, while the rear of it rested
on the track and stayed the course of the remainder
of the train. Including those in the smoking compartment
more than a hundred persons were plunged
into the channel, of whom forty-six lost their lives,
while some thirty others were more or less severely
injured. The killed were mainly among the passengers
in the first car; for, in falling, the roof of the
second car was split open, and it finally rested in
such a position that, as no succeeding car came on
top of it, many of those in it were enabled to extricate
themselves; indeed, more than one of the passengers
in falling were absolutely thrown through
the aperture in the roof, and, without any volition on
their part, were saved with unmoistened garments.</p>

<p>Shocking as this catastrophe was, it was eclipsed
in horror by another exactly similar in character,
though from the peculiar circumstances of the case
it excited far less public notice, which occurred
eleven years later on the Grand Trunk railway of
Canada. In this case a large party of emigrants,
over 500 in number and chiefly Poles, Germans and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Norwegians of the better class, had landed at Quebec
and were being forwarded on a special train to
their destination in the West. With their baggage
they filled thirteen cars. The Grand Trunk on
the way to Montreal crosses the Richelieu river at
Bel&oelig;il by an iron bridge, in the westernmost span
of which was a draw over the canal, some 45 feet
below it. Both by law and under the running rules
of the road all trains were to come to a dead stand
on approaching the bridge, and to proceed only
when the safety signal was clearly discerned. This
rule, however, as it appeared at the subsequent inquest,
had been systematically disobeyed, it having
been considered sufficient if the train was
"slowed down." In the present case, however&mdash;the
night of June 29, 1864,&mdash;though the danger signal
was displayed and in full sight for a distance of
1,600 feet, the engine-driver, unfamiliar with the road
and its signals, failed to see it, and, without slowing
his train even, ran directly onto the bridge. He became
aware of the danger when too late to stop. The
draw was open to permit the passage of a steamer
with six barges in tow, one of which was directly under
the opening. The whole train went through the
draw, sinking the barge and piling itself up in the
water on top of it. The three last cars, falling on
the accumulated wreck, toppled over upon the west
embankment and were thus less injured than the
others. The details of the accident were singularly
distressing. "As soon as possible a strong cable was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
attached to the upper part of the piling, and by this
means two cars, the last of the ill-fated train, were
dragged onto the wharf under the bridge. Their
removal revealed a horrible sight. A shapeless blue
mass of hands and heads and feet protruded among
the splinters and frame-work, and gradually resolved
itself into a closely-packed mass of human beings,
all ragged and bloody and dinted from crown to foot
with blue bruises and weals and cuts inflicted by the
ponderous iron work, the splinters and the enormous
weight of the train. * * * A great many of
the dead had evidently been asleep; the majority of
them had taken off their boots and coats in the
endeavor to make themselves as comfortable as possible.
They lay heaped upon one another like sacks,
dressed in the traditional blue clothing of the German
people. * * * A child was got at and removed
nine hours after the accident, being uninjured
in its dead mother's arms."</p>

<p>The accident happened at 2 <small>A.M.</small>, and before sundown
of the next day 86 bodies had been taken out
of the canal; others were subsequently recovered,
and yet more died from their hurts. The injured
were numbered by hundreds. It was altogether a
disaster of the most appalling description, in extenuation
of which nothing was to be said. It befell,
however, a body of comparatively friendless emigrants,
and excited not a tithe of the painful interest
which yet attaches to the similar accident to the
Boston express at Norwalk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>These terrible disasters were both due, not alone
to the carelessness of the two engine-drivers, but
to the use of a crude and inadequate system of signals.
It so happened, however, that the legislature
of Connecticut was unfortunately in session at the
time of the Norwalk disaster, and consequently the
public panic and indignation took shape in a law
compelling every train on the railroads of that
state to come to a dead stand-still before entering
upon any bridge in which there was a draw.
This law is still in force, and from time to time, as
after the New Hamburg catastrophe, an unreasoning
clamor is raised for it in other states. In
point of fact it imposes a most absurd, unnecessary
and annoying delay on travel, and rests upon the
Connecticut statute book a curious illustration of
what usually happens when legislators undertake
to incorporate running railroad regulations into the
statutes-at-large. It is of a par with another law,
which has for more than twenty-five years been in
force in Connecticut's sister state of Massachusetts,
compelling in all cases where the tracks of different
companies cross each other at a level the trains of
each company to stop before reaching the crossing,
and then to pass over it slowly. The danger of
collision at crossings is undoubtedly much greater
than that of going through open draws. Precautions
against danger in each case are unquestionably
proper and they cannot be too perfect, but to
have recourse to stopping either in the one case or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the other simply reveals an utter ignorance of the
great advance which has been made in railroad signals
and the science of interlocking. In both these
cases it is, indeed, entitled to just about the same
degree of respect as would be a proposal to recur
to pioneer engines as a means of preventing accidents
to night trains.</p>

<p>The machinery by means of which both draws
and grade crossings can be protected, will be referred
to in another connection,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> meanwhile it is
a curious fact that neither at grade crossings nor
at draws has the mere stopping of trains proved
a sufficient protection. Several times in the experience
of Massachusetts' roads have those in
charge of locomotives, after stopping and while
moving at a slow rate of speed, actually run themselves
into draws with their eyes open, and afterwards
been wholly unable to give any satisfactory
explanation of their conduct. But the insufficiency
of stopping as a reliable means of prevention was
especially illustrated in the case of an accident which
occurred upon the Boston &amp; Maine railroad on the
morning of the 21st of November, 1862, when the
early local passenger train was run into the open
draw of the bridge almost at the entrance to the
Boston station. It so happened that the train had
stopped at the Charlestown station just before going
onto the bridge, and at the time the accident
occurred was moving at a speed scarcely faster than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
a man could walk; and yet the locomotive was
entirely submerged, as the water at that point is
deep, and the only thing which probably saved the
train was that the draw was so narrow and the cars
were so long that the foremost one lodged across
the opening, and its forward end only was beneath
the water. At the rate at which the train was moving
the resistance thus offered was sufficient to stop
it, though, even as it was, no less than six persons
lost their lives and a much larger number were more
or less injured. Here all the precautions imposed
by the Connecticut law were taken, and served only
to reveal the weak point in it. The accident was
due to the neglect of the corporation in not having
the draw and its system of signals interlocked in
such a way that the movement of the one should
automatically cause a corresponding movement of
the other; and this neglect in high quarters made it
possible for a careless employé to open the draw on
a particularly dark and foggy morning, while he
forgot at the same time to shift his signals. An
exactly similar instance of carelessness on the
part of an employé resulted in the derailment of a
train upon the Long Branch line of the Central
Road of New Jersey at the Shrewsbury river draw
on August 9, 1877. In this case the safety signal
was shown while the draw fastening had been left
unsecured. The jar of the passing train threw the
draw slightly open so as to disconnect the tracks;
thus causing the derailment of the train, which subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
plunged over the side of the bridge. Fortunately
the tide was out, or there would have been
a terrible loss of life; as it was, some seventy persons
were injured, five of whom subsequently died.
This accident also, like that on the Boston &amp; Maine
road in 1862, very forcibly illustrated the necessity
of an interlocking apparatus. The safety signal was
shown before the draw was secured, which should
have been impossible.</p>

<p>Prior to the year 1873 there is no consecutive record
of this or any other class of railroad accidents
occurring in America, but during the six years 1873-8
there occurred twenty-one cases of minor disaster at
draws, three only of them to passenger trains. Altogether,
excluding the Shrewsbury river accident,
these resulted in the death of five employés and injury
to one other. No passenger was hurt. In
Great Britain not a single case of disaster of any
description has been reported as occurring at a draw-bridge
since the year 1870, when the present system
of official Board of Trade reports was begun. The
lesson clearly to be drawn from a careful investigation
of all the American accidents reported would
seem to be that a statute provision making compulsory
the interlocking of all draws in railroad bridges
with a proper and infallible system of signals might
have claims on the consideration of an intelligent
legislature; not so an enactment which compels the
stopping of trains at points where danger is small,
and makes no provision as respects other points
where it is great.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>BRIDGE ACCIDENTS.</h3>


<p>Great as were the terrors inspired by the Norwalk
disaster in those comparatively early days of
railroad experience, and deep as the impression on
the public memory must have been to leave its
mark on the statute book even to the present time,
that and the similar disaster at the Richelieu river
are believed to have been the only two of great
magnitude which have occurred at open railroad
draws. That this should be so is well calculated
to excite surprise, for the draw-bridge precautions
against accident in America are wretchedly crude
and inadequate, amounting as a rule to little more
than the primitive balls and targets by day and lanterns
by night, without any system of alarms or interlocking.
Electricity as an adjunct to human care,
or a corrective rather of human negligence, is almost
never used; and, in fact, the chief reliance is still
on the vigilance of engine-drivers. But, if accidents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
at draws have been comparatively rare and
unattended with any considerable loss of life, it
has been far otherwise with the rest of the structures
of which the draw forms a part. Bridge accidents
in fact always have been, and will probably
always remain, incomparably the worst to which
travel by rail is exposed. It would be impossible
for corporations to take too great precautions
against them, and that the precautions taken are
very great is conclusively shown by the fact that,
with thousands of bridges many times each day
subjected to the strain of the passage at speed of
heavy trains, so very few disasters occur. When
they do occur, however, the lessons taught by them
are, though distinct enough, apt to be in one important
respect of a far less satisfactory character
than those taught by collisions. In the case of
these last the great resultant fact speaks for itself.
The whole community knows when it sees a block
system, or a stronger car construction, or an improved
train brake suddenly introduced that the
sacrifice has not been in vain&mdash;that the lesson has
been learned. It is by no means always so in the
case of accidents on bridges. With these the cause
of disaster is apt to be so scientific in its nature that
it cannot even be described, except through the use
of engineering terms which to the mass of readers
are absolutely incomprehensible. The simplest of
railroad bridges is an inexplicable mystery to at
least ninety-nine persons out of each hundred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Even when the cause of disaster is understood, the
precautions taken against its recurrence cannot be
seen. From the nature of the case they must consist
chiefly of a better material, or a more scientific
construction, or an increased watchfulness
on the part of officials and subordinates. This,
however, is not apparent on the surface, and, when
the next accident of the same nature occurs, the
inference, as inevitable as it is usually unjust, is
at once drawn that the one which preceded it had
been productive of no results. The truth of this
was strongly illustrated by the two bridge accidents
which happened, the one at Ashtabula, Ohio,
on the 29th of December, 1876, and the other
at Tariffville, Connecticut, on the 15th of January,
1878.</p>

<p>There has been no recent disaster which combined
more elements of horror or excited more widespread
public emotion than that at Ashtabula bridge. It
was, indeed, so terrible in its character and so heart-rending
in its details, that for the time being it fairly
divided the attention of the country with that dispute
over the presidential succession, then the subject
uppermost in the minds of all. A blinding northeasterly
snow-storm, accompanied by a heavy wind,
prevailed throughout the day which preceded the
accident, greatly impeding the movement of trains.
The Pacific express over the Michigan Southern &amp;
Lake Shore road had left Erie, going west, considerably
behind its time, and had been started only with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
great difficulty and with the assistance of four locomotives.
It was due at Ashtabula at about 5.30
o'clock <small>P.M.</small>, but was three hours late, and, the days
being then at their shortest, when it arrived at the
bridge which was the scene of the accident the darkness
was so great that nothing could be seen through
the driving snow by those on the leading locomotive
even for a distance of 50 feet ahead. The train was
made up of two heavy locomotives, four baggage,
mail and express cars, one smoking car, two ordinary
coaches, a drawing-room car and three sleepers, being
in all two locomotives and eleven cars, in the
order named, containing, as nearly as can be ascertained,
190 human beings, of whom 170 were passengers.
Ashtabula bridge is situated only about
1,000 feet east of the station of the same name, and
spans a deep ravine, at the bottom of which flows a
shallow stream, some two or three feet in depth,
which empties into Lake Erie a mile or two away.
The bridge was an iron Howe truss of 150 feet span,
elevated 69 feet above the bottom of the ravine, and
supported at either end by solid masonwork abutments.
It had been built some fourteen years. As
the train approached the bridge it had to force its
way through a heavy snow-drift, and, when it passed
onto it, it was moving at a speed of some twelve or
fourteen miles an hour. The entire length of the
bridge afforded space only for two of the express
cars at most in addition to the locomotives, so that
when the wheels of the leading locomotive rested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
on the western abutment of the bridge nine of the
eleven cars which made up the train, including all
those in which there were passengers, had yet to
reach its eastern end. At the instant when the
train stood in this position, the engineer of the
leading locomotive heard a sudden cracking sound
apparently beneath him, and thought he felt the
bridge giving way. Instantly pulling the throttle
valve wide open, his locomotive gave a spring forward
and, as it did so, the bridge fell, the rear wheels
of his tender falling with it. The jerk and impetus
of the locomotive, however, sufficed to tear out the
coupling, and as his tender was dragged up out of the
abyss onto the track, though its rear wheels did not
get upon the rails, the frightened engineer caught
a fearful glimpse of the second locomotive as it
seemed to turn and then fall bottom upwards into
the ravine. The bridge had given way, not at
once but by a slowly sinking motion, which began
at the point where the pressure was heaviest,
under the two locomotives and at the west abutment.
There being two tracks, and this train being
on the southernmost of the two, the southern truss
had first yielded, letting that side of the bridge
down, and rolling, as it were, the second locomotive
and the cars immediately behind it off to the
left and quite clear of a straight line drawn between
the two abutments; then almost immediately
the other truss gave way and the whole
bridge fell, but in doing so swung slightly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
right. Before this took place the entire train with
the exception of the last two sleepers had reached
the chasm, each car as it passed over falling nearer
than the one which had preceded it to the east
abutment, and finally the last two sleepers came,
and, without being deflected from their course at
all, plunged straight down and fell upon the wreck
of the bridge at its east end. It was necessarily
all the work of a few seconds.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the ravine the snow lay waist
deep and the stream was covered with ice some
eight inches in thickness. Upon this were piled up
the fallen cars and engine, the latter on top of the
former near the western abutment and upside down.
All the passenger cars were heated by stoves. At
first a dead silence seemed to follow the successive
shocks of the falling mass. In less than two minutes,
however, the fire began to show itself and
within fifteen the holocaust was at its height. As
usual, it was a mass of human beings, all more or
less stunned, a few killed, many injured and helpless,
and more yet simply pinned down to watch, in
the possession as full as helpless of all their faculties,
the rapid approach of the flames. The number
of those killed outright seems to have been surprisingly
small. In the last car, for instance, no one
was lost. This was due to the energy and presence
of mind of the porter, a negro named Steward, who,
when he felt the car resting firmly on its side, broke
a window and crawled through it, and then passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
along breaking the other windows and extricating the
passengers until all were gotten out. Those in the
other cars were far less fortunate. Though an immediate
alarm had been given in the neighboring
town, the storm was so violent and the snow so
deep that assistance arrived but slowly. Nor when
it did arrive could much be effected. The essential
thing was to extinguish the flames. The means for
so doing were close at hand in a steam pump belonging
to the railroad company, while an abundance
of hose could have been procured at another place
but a short distance off. In the excitement and
agitation of the moment contradictory orders were
given, even to forbidding the use of the pump, and
practically no effort to extinguish the fire was made.
Within half an hour of the accident the flames were
at their height, and when the next morning dawned
nothing remained in the ravine but a charred and
undistinguishable mass of car trucks, brake-rods,
twisted rails and bent and tangled bridge iron,
with the upturned locomotive close to the west
abutment.</p>

<p>In this accident some eighty persons are supposed
to have lost their lives, while over sixty others were
injured. The exact number of those killed can
never be known, however, as more than half of
those reported were utterly consumed in the fire;
indeed, even of the bodies recovered scarcely one
half could be identified. Of the cause of the disaster
much was said at the time in language most unnecessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
scientific;&mdash;but little was required to be
said. It admitted of no extenuation. An iron
bridge, built in the early days of iron-bridges,&mdash;that
which fell under the train at Ashtabula, was faulty
in its original construction, and the indications of
weakness it had given had been distinct, but had
not been regarded. That it had stood so long and
that it should have given way when it did, were
equally matters for surprise. A double track bridge,
it should naturally have fallen under the combined
pressure of trains moving simultaneously in opposite
directions. The strain under which it yielded
was not a particularly severe one, even taken in connection
with the great atmospheric pressure of the
storm then prevailing. It was, in short, one of those
disasters, fortunately of infrequent occurrence, with
which accident has little if any connection. It was
due to original inexperience and to subsequent ignorance
or carelessness, or possibly recklessness as
criminal as it was fool-hardy.</p>

<p>Besides being a bridge accident, this was also a
stove accident,&mdash;in this respect a repetition of Angola.
One of the most remarkable features about
it, indeed, was the fearful rapidity with which the
fire spread, and the incidents of its spread detailed
in the subsequent evidence of the survivors were
simply horrible. Men, women and children, full of
the instinct of self-preservation, were caught and
pinned fast for the advancing flames, while those
who tried to rescue them were driven back by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
heat and compelled helplessly to listen to their
shrieks. It is, however, unnecessary to enter into
these details, for they are but the repetition of an
experience which has often been told, and they do
but enforce a lesson which the railroad companies
seem resolved not to learn. Unquestionably the
time in this country will come when through trains
will be heated from a locomotive or a heating-car.
That time, however, had not yet come. Meanwhile
the evidence would seem to show that at
Ashtabula, as at Angola, at least two lives were
sacrificed in the subsequent fire to each one lost in
the immediate shock of the disaster.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>But a few days more than a year after the Ashtabula
accident another catastrophe, almost exactly
similar in its details, occurred on the Connecticut
Western road. It is impossible to even estimate
the amount of overhauling to which bridges
throughout the country had in the meanwhile been
subjected, or the increased care used in their examination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
All that can be said is that during the year
1877 no serious accident due to the inherent weakness
of any bridge occcurred on the 70,000 miles of
American railroad. Neither, so far as can be ascertained,
was the Tariffville disaster to be referred to
that cause. It happened on the evening of January
15, 1878. A large party of excursionists were returning
from a Moody and Sankey revival meeting
on a special train, consisting of two locomotives
and ten cars. Half a mile west of Tariffville the
railroad crosses the Farmington river. The bridge
at this point was a wooden Howe truss, with
two spans of 163 feet each. It had been in use
about seven years and, originally of ample
strength and good construction, there is no evidence
that its strength had since been unduly impaired
by neglect or exposure. It should, therefore,
have sufficed to bear twice the strain to which
it was now subjected. Exactly as at Ashtabula,
however, the west span of the bridge gave way
under the train just as the leading locomotives
passed onto the tressel-work beyond it: the ice
broke under the falling wreck, and the second locomotive
with four cars were precipitated into the
river. The remaining cars were stopped by the
rear end of the third car, resting as it did on
the centre pier of the bridge, and did not leave
the rails. The fall to the surface of the ice was
about ten feet. There was no fire to add to the
horrors in this case, but thirteen persons were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
crushed to death or drowned, and thirty-three
others injured.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Naturally the popular inference was at once
drawn that this was a mere repetition of the
Ashtabula experience,&mdash;that the fearful earlier lesson
had been thrown away on a corporation either
unwilling or not caring to learn. The newspapers
far and wide resounded with ill considered denunciation,
and the demand was loud for legislation
of the crudest conceivable character, especially a
law prohibiting the passage over any bridge of two
locomotives attached to one passenger train. The
fact, however, seems to be that, except in its superficial
details, the Tariffville disaster had no features
in common with that at Ashtabula; as nearly as
can be ascertained it was due neither to the weakness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
nor to the overloading of the bridge. Though
the evidence subsequently given is not absolutely
conclusive on this point, the probabilities would
seem to be that, while on the bridge, the second
locomotive was derailed in some unexplained way
and consequently fell on the stringers which yielded
under the sudden blow. The popular impression,
therefore, as to the bearing which the first of these
two strikingly similar accidents had upon the last
tended only to bring about results worse than useless.
The bridge fell, not under the steady weight
of two locomotives, but under the sudden shock
incident to the derailment of one. The remedy,
therefore, lay in the direction of so planking or
otherwise guarding the floors of similar bridges that
in case of derailment the locomotives or cars should
not fall on the stringers or greatly diverge from the
rails so as to endanger the trusses. On the other
hand the suggestion of a law prohibiting the passage
over bridges of more than one locomotive with any
passenger train, while in itself little better than a
legal recognition of bad bridge building, also served
to divert public attention from the true lesson of
the disaster. Another newspaper precaution, very
favorably considered at the time, was the putting
of one locomotive, where two had to be used, at the
rear end of the train as a pusher, instead of both in
front. This expedient might indeed obviate one
cause of danger, but it would do so only by substituting
for it another which has been the fruitful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
source of some of the worst railroad disasters on
record.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>THE PROTECTION OF BRIDGES.</h3>


<p>Long, varied and terrible as the record of bridge
disasters has become, there are, nevertheless, certain
very simple and inexpensive precautions against
them, which, altogether too frequently, corporations
do not and will not take. At Ashtabula the bridge
gave way. There was no derailment as there seems
to have been at Tariffville. The sustaining power
of a bridge is, of course, a question comparatively
difficult of ascertainment. A fatal weakness in this
respect may be discernable only to the eye of a
trained expert. Derailment, however, either upon
a bridge, or when approaching it, is in the vast
majority of cases a danger perfectly easy to guard
against. The precautions are simple and they are
not expensive, yet, taking the railroads of the United
States as a whole, it may well be questioned whether
the bridges at which they have been taken do not
constitute the exception rather than the rule. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
only is the average railroad superintendent accustomed
to doing his work and running his road under
a constant pressure to make both ends meet, which,
as he well knows, causes his own daily bread to depend
upon the economies he can effect; but, while
he finds it hard work at best to provide for the
multifarious outlays, long immunity from disaster
breeds a species of recklessness even in the most
cautious:&mdash;and yet the single mishap in a thousand
must surely fall to the lot of some one. Many
years ago the terrible results which must soon or
late be expected wherever the consequences of a
derailment on the approaches to a bridge are not
securely guarded against, were illustrated by a disaster
on the Great Western railroad of Canada, which
combined many of the worst horrors of both the
Norwalk and the New Hamburg tragedies; more
recently the almost forgotten lesson was enforced
again on the Vermont &amp; Massachusetts road, upon
the bridge over the Miller River, at Athol. The
accident last referred to occurred on the 16th of
June, 1870, but, though forcible enough as a reminder,
it was tame indeed in comparison with the
Des Jardines Canal disaster, which is still remembered
though it happened so long ago as the 17th
of March, 1857.</p>

<p>The Great Western railroad of Canada crossed
the canal by a bridge at an elevation of about sixty
feet. At the time of the accident there were some
eighteen feet of water in the canal, though, as is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
usual in Canada at that season, it was covered by
ice some two feet in thickness. On the afternoon
of the 17th of March as the local accommodation
train from Hamilton was nearing the bridge, its locomotive,
though it was then moving at a very slow
rate of speed, was in some way thrown from the
track and onto the timbers of the bridge. These
it cut through, and then falling heavily on the string-pieces
it parted them, and instantly pitched headlong
down upon the frozen surface of the canal below,
dragging after it the tender, baggage car and
two passenger cars, which composed the whole train.
There was nothing whatever to break the fall of
sixty feet; and even then two feet of ice only intervened
between the ruins of the train and the bottom
of the canal eighteen feet below. Two feet of solid
ice will afford no contemptible resistance to a falling
body; the locomotive and tender crushed heavily
through it and instantly sank out of sight. In falling
the baggage car struck a corner of the tender and
was thus thrown some ten yards to one side, and was
followed by the first passenger car, which, turning a
somersault as it went, fell on its roof and was crushed
to fragments, but only partially broke through
the ice, upon which the next car fell endwise, and
rested in that position. That every human being
in the first car was either crushed or drowned seems
most natural; the only cause for astonishment is
found in the fact that any one should have survived
such a catastrophe,&mdash;a tumble of sixty feet on ice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
as solid as a rock! Yet of four persons in the baggage
car three went down with it, and not one of
them was more than slightly injured. The engineer
and fireman, and the occupants of the second passenger
car, were less fortunate. The former were
found crushed under the locomotive at the bottom
of the canal; while of the latter ten were killed, and
not one escaped severe injury. Very rarely indeed in
the history of railroad accidents have so large a
portion of those on the train lost their lives as in
this case, for out of ninety persons sixty perished,
and in the number was included every woman and
child among the passengers, with a single exception.</p>

<p>There were two circumstances about this disaster
worthy of especial notice. In the first place, as
well as can now be ascertained in the absence of
any trustworthy record of an investigation into
causes, the accident was easily preventable. It
appears to have been immediately caused by the
derailment of a locomotive, however occasioned,
just as it was entering on a swing draw-bridge.
Thrown from the tracks, there was nothing in the
flooring to prevent the derailed locomotive from
deflecting from its course until it toppled over the
ends of the ties, nor were the ties and the flooring
apparently sufficiently strong to sustain it even
while it held to its course. Under such circumstances
the derailment of a locomotive upon any
bridge can mean only destruction; it meant it then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
it means it now; and yet our country is to-day full
of bridges constructed in an exactly similar way.
To make accidents from this cause, if not impossible
at least highly improbable, it is only necessary to
make the ties and flooring of all bridges between the
tracks and for three feet on either side of them sufficiently
strong to sustain the whole weight of a
train off the track and in motion, while a third rail,
or strong truss of wood, securely fastened, should
be laid down midway between the rails throughout
the entire length of the bridge and its approaches.
With this arrangement, as the flanges of the wheels
are on the inside, it must follow that in case of derailment
and a divergence to one side or the other
of the bridge, the inner side of the flange will come
against the central rail or truss just so soon as the
divergence amounts to half the space between the
rails, which in the ordinary gauge is two feet and
four inches. The wheels must then glide along this
guard, holding the train from any further divergence
from its course, until it can be checked. Meanwhile,
as the ties and flooring extend for the space of three
feet outside of the track, a sufficient support is furnished
by them for the other wheels. A legislative
enactment compelling the construction of all bridges
in this way, coupled with additional provisions for
interlocking of draws with their signals in cases of
bridges across navigable waters, would be open to
objection that laws against dangers of accident by
rail have almost invariably proved ineffective when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
they were not absurd, but in itself, if enforced,
it might not improbably render disasters like
those at Norwalk and Des Jardines terrors of the
past.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>CAR-COUPLINGS IN DERAILMENTS.</h3>


<p>Wholly apart from the derailment, which was
the real occasion of the Des Jardines disaster, there
was one other cause which largely contributed to
its fatality, if indeed that fatality was not in greatest
part immediately due to it.</p>

<p>The question as to what is the best method of
coupling together the several individual vehicles
which make up every railroad train has always been
much discussed among railroad mechanics. The decided
weight of opinion has been in favor of the
strongest and closest couplings, so that under no circumstances
should the train separate into parts.
Taking all forms of railroad accident together, this
conclusion is probably sound. It is, however, at best
only a balancing of disadvantages,&mdash;a mere question
as to which practice involves the least amount of
danger. Yet a very terrible demonstration that there
are two sides to this as to most other questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
was furnished at Des Jardines. It was the custom
on the Great Western road not only to couple the
cars together in the method then in general use, but
also, as is often done now, to connect them by heavy
chains on each side of the centre coupling. Accordingly
when the locomotive broke through the Des
Jardines bridge, it dragged the rest of the train hopelessly
after it. This certainly would not have happened
had the modern self-coupler been in use, and
probably would not have happened had the cars
been connected only by the ordinary link and pins;
for the train was going very slowly, and the signal
for brakes was given in ample time to apply them
vigorously before the last cars came to the opening,
into which they were finally dragged by the dead
weight before them and not hurried by their own
momentum.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have not far to go in search
of scarcely less fatal disasters illustrating with equal
force the other side of the proposition, in the terrible
consequences which have ensued from the separation
of cars in cases of derailment. Take, for
instance, the memorable accident of June 17, 1858,
near Port Jervis, on the Erie railway.</p>

<p>As the express train from New York was running
at a speed of about thirty miles an hour over a perfectly
straight piece of track between Otisville and
Port Jervis, shortly after dark on the evening of that
day, it encountered a broken rail. The train was
made up of a locomotive, two baggage cars and five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
passenger cars, all of which except the last passed
safely over the fractured rail. The last car was apparently
derailed, and drew the car before it off
the track. These two cars were then dragged along,
swaying fearfully from side to side, for a distance
of some four hundred feet, when the couplings
at last snapped and they went over the embankment,
which was there some thirty feet in height.
As they rushed down the slope the last car turned
fairly over, resting finally on its roof, while one of
its heavy iron trucks broke through and fell upon
the passengers beneath, killing and maiming them.
The other car, more fortunate, rested at last upon
its side on a pile of stones at the foot of the embankment.
Six persons were killed and fifty severely
injured; all of the former in the last car.</p>

<p>In this case, had the couplings held, the derailed
cars would not have gone over the embankment and
but slight injuries would have been sustained. Modern
improvements have, however, created safeguards
sufficient to prevent the recurrence of other accidents
under the same conditions as that at Port
Jervis. The difficulty lay in the inability to stop a
train, though moving at only moderate speed, within
a reasonable time. The wretched inefficiency of the
old hand-brake in a sudden emergency received one
more illustration. The train seems to have run
nearly half a mile after the accident took place before
it could be stopped, although the engineer had
instant notice of it and reversed his locomotive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
The couplings did not snap until a distance had
been traversed in which the modern train-brake
would have reduced the speed to a point at which
they would have been subjected to no dangerous
strain.</p>

<p>The accident ten years later at Carr's Rock, sixteen
miles west of Port Jervis, on the same road, was
again very similar to the one just described: and
yet in this case the parting of the couplings alone
prevented the rear of the train from dragging its
head to destruction. Both disasters were occasioned
by broken rails; but, while the first occurred on a
tangent, the last was at a point where the road
skirted the hills, by a sharp curve, upon the outer
side of which was a steep declivity of some eighty
feet, jagged with rock and bowlders. It befell
the night express on the 14th of April, 1876.
The train was a long one, consisting of the locomotive,
three baggage and express, and seven passenger
cars, and it encountered the broken rail while
rounding the curve at a high rate of speed. Again
all except the last car, passed over the fracture in
safety; this was snapped, as it were, off the track
and over the embankment. At first it was dragged
along, but only for a short distance; the intense
strain then broke the coupling between the four
rear cars and the head of the train, and, the last of
the four being already over the embankment, the
others almost instantly toppled over after it and
rolled down the ravine. A passenger on this portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of the train, described the car he was in "as
going over and over, until the outer roof was torn
off, the sides fell out, and the inner roof was crushed
in." Twenty-four persons were killed and eighty
injured; but in this instance, as in that at Des
Jardines, the only occasion for surprise was that
there were any survivors.</p>

<p>Accidents arising from the parting of defective
couplings have of course not been uncommon, and
they constitute one of the greatest dangers incident
to heavy gradients; in surmounting inclines freight
trains will, it is found, break in two, and their hinder
parts come thundering down the grade, as was seen
at Abergele. The American passenger trains, in
which each car is provided with brakes, are much
less liable than the English, the speed of which is
regulated by brake-vans, to accidents of this description.
Indeed, it may be questioned whether in
America any serious disaster has occurred from the
fact that a portion of a passenger train on a road
operated by steam got beyond control in descending
an incline. There have been, however, terrible
catastrophes from this cause in England, and that
on the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire road near Helmshere,
a station some fourteen miles north of Manchester,
deserves a prominent place in the record
of railroad accidents.</p>

<p>It occurred in the early hours of the morning of
the 4th of September, 1860. There had been a
great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> at the Bellevue Gardens in Manchester on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the 3d, upon the conclusion of which some twenty-five
hundred persons crowded at once upon the return
trains. Of these there were, on the Lancashire
&amp; Yorkshire road, three; the first consisting of fourteen,
the second of thirty-one, and the last of twenty-four
carriages: and they were started, with intervals
of ten minutes between them, at about eleven o'clock
at night. The first train finished its journey in
safety. Not so the second and the third. The
Helmshere station is at the top of a steep incline.
This the second train, drawn by two locomotives,
surmounted, and then stopped for the delivery of
passengers. While these were leaving the carriages,
a snap as of fractured iron was heard, and the
guards, looking back, saw the whole rear portion of
the train, consisting of seventeen carriages and a
brake-van, detached from the rest of it and quietly
slipping down the incline. The detached portion
was moving so slowly that one of the guards succeeded
in catching the van and applying the brakes;
it was, however, already too late. The velocity was
greater than the brake-power could overcome, and
the seventeen carriages kept descending more and
more rapidly. Meanwhile the third train had reached
the foot of the incline and begun to ascend it, when
its engineer, on rounding a curve, caught sight of
the descending carriages. He immediately reversed
his engine, but before he could bring his train to a
stand they were upon him. Fortunately the van-brakes
of the detached carriages, though insufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
to stop them, yet did reduce their speed; the collision
nevertheless was terrific. The force of the
blow, so far as the advancing train was concerned,
expended itself on the locomotive, which was demolished,
while the passengers escaped with a fright.
Not so those in the descending carriages. With
them there was nothing to break the blow, and the
two hindmost carriages were crushed to fragments
and their passengers scattered over the line. It was
shortly after midnight, and the excursionists clambered
out of the trains and rushed frantically about,
impeding every effort to clear away the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> and
rescue the injured, whose shrieks and cries were
incessant. The bodies of ten persons, one of whom
had died of suffocation, were ultimately taken out
from the wreck, and twenty-two others sustained
fractures of limbs.</p>

<p>At Des Jardines the couplings were too strong;
at Port Jervis and at Helmshere they were not
strong enough; at Carr's Rock they gave way not a
moment too soon. "There are objections to a
plenum and there are objections to a vacuum," as
Dr. Johnson remarked, "but a plenum or a vacuum
it must be." There are no arguments, however, in
favor of putting railroad stations or sidings upon
an inclined plane, and then not providing what the
English call "catch-points" or "scotches" to prevent
such disasters as those at Abergele or Helmshere.
In these two instances alone the want of
them cost over fifty lives. In railroad mechanics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
there are after all some principles susceptible of
demonstration. That vehicles, as well as water, will
run down hill may be classed among them. That
these principles should still be ignored is hardly
less singular than it is surprising.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>THE REVERE CATASTROPHE.</h3>


<p>The terrible disaster which occurred in front of
the little station-building at Revere, six miles from
Boston on the Eastern railroad of Massachusetts, in
August 1871, was, properly speaking, not an accident
at all; it was essentially a catastrophe&mdash;the legitimate
and almost inevitable final outcome of an antiquated
and insufficient system. As such it should long remain
a subject for prayerful meditation to all those
who may at any time be entrusted with the immediate
operating of railroads. It was terribly dramatic,
but it was also frightfully instructive; and
while the lesson was by no means lost, it yet admits
of further and advantageous study. For, like most
other men whose lives are devoted to a special calling,
the managers of railroads are apt to be very
much wedded to their own methods, and attention
has already more than once been called to the fact
that, when any new emergency necessitates a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
appliance, they not infrequently, as Captain Tyler
well put it in his report to the Board of Trade
for the year 1870, "display more ingenuity in finding
objections than in overcoming them."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 195px;">
<img src="images/i_126.jpg" width="195" height="300" alt="map" />
</div>

<p>The Eastern railroad of Massachusetts connects
Boston with Portland, in the state of Maine, by a
line which is located close along the sea-shore. Between
Boston and Lynn, a distance of eleven miles,
the main road is in large part built across the salt
marshes, but there is a branch which leaves it at
Everett, a small station some miles out of Boston,
and thence, running deviously through a succession
of towns on the higher ground, connects with the
main track again at Lynn; thus making what is
known in England as a loop-road. At the time of
the Revere accident this
branch was equipped with
but a single track, and
was operated wholly by
schedule without any reliance
on the telegraph;
and, indeed, there were
not even telegraphic offices
at a number of the
stations upon it. Revere,
the name of the station
where the accident took
place, was on the main
line about five miles from
Boston and two miles
from Everett, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Saugus branch, as the loop-road was called, began.
The accompanying diagram shows the relative position
of the several points and of the main and
branch lines, a thorough appreciation of which is
essential to a correct understanding of the disaster.</p>

<p>The travel over the Eastern railroad is of a somewhat
exceptional nature, varying in a more than
ordinary degree with the different seasons of the
year. During the winter months the corporation
had, in 1871, to provide for a regular passenger
movement of about seventy-five thousand a week,
but in the summer what is known as the excursion
and pleasure travel not infrequently increased the
number to one hundred and ten thousand, and even
more. As a natural consequence, during certain
weeks of each summer, and more especially towards
the close of August, it was no unusual thing for the
corporation to find itself taxed beyond its utmost
resources. It is emergencies of this description,
periodically occurring on every railroad, which always
subject to the final test the organization and
discipline of companies and the capacity of superintendents.
A railroad in quiet times is like a ship in
steady weather; almost anybody can manage the
one or sail the other. It is the sudden stress which
reveals the undeveloped strength or the hidden
weakness; and the truly instructive feature in the
Revere accident lay in the amount of hidden weakness
everywhere which was brought to light under
that sudden stress. During the week ending with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
that Saturday evening upon which the disaster occurred
the rolling stock of the road had been heavily
taxed, not only to accommodate the usual tide of
summer travel, then at its full flood, but also those
attending a military muster and two large camp-meetings
upon its line. The number of passengers
going over it had accordingly risen from about one
hundred and ten thousand, the full summer average,
to over one hundred and forty thousand; while instead
of the one hundred and fifty-two trains a day
provided for in the running schedule, there were no
less than one hundred and ninety-two. It had never
been the custom with those managing the road to
place any reliance upon the telegraph in directing
the train movement, and no use whatever appears to
have been made of it towards straightening out the
numerous hitches inevitable from so sudden an increase
in that movement. If an engine broke down,
or a train got off the track, there had accordingly
throughout that week been nothing done, except
patient and general waiting, until things got in
motion again; each conductor or station-master had
to look out for himself, under the running regulations
of the road, and need expect no assistance
from headquarters. This, too, in spite of the fact
that, including the Saugus branch, no less than
ninety-three of the entire one hundred and fifteen
miles of road operated by the company were supplied
only with a single track. The whole train movement,
both of the main line and of the branches, intricate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
in the extreme as it was, thus depended solely
on a schedule arrangement and the watchful intelligence
of individual employés. Not unnaturally,
therefore, as the week drew to a close the confusion
became so great that the trains reached and left the
Boston station with an almost total disregard of the
schedule; while towards the evening of Saturday
the employés of the road at that station directed
their efforts almost exclusively to dispatching trains
as fast as cars could be procured, thus trying to keep
it as clear as possible of the throng of impatient travellers
which continually blocked it up. Taken altogether
the situation illustrated in a very striking
manner that singular reliance of the corporation on
the individuality and intelligence of its employés,
which in another connection is referred to as one of
the most striking characteristics of American railroad
management, without a full appreciation of
which it is impossible to understand its using or
failing to use certain appliances.</p>

<p>According to the regular schedule four trains
should have left the Boston station in succession
during the hour and a half between 6.30 and eight
o'clock <small>P.M.</small>: a Saugus branch train for Lynn at
6.30; a second Saugus branch train at seven; an accommodation
train, which ran eighteen miles over
the main line, at 7.15; and finally the express train
through to Portland, also over the main line, at eight
o'clock. The collision at Revere was between these
last two trains, the express overtaking and running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
into the rear of the accommodation train; but it was
indirectly caused by the delays and irregularity in
movement of the two branch trains. It will be noticed
that, according to the schedule, both of the
branch trains should have preceded the accommodation
train; in the prevailing confusion, however,
the first of the two branch trains did not leave the
station until about seven o'clock, thirty minutes behind
its time, and it was followed forty minutes later,
not by the second branch train, but by the accommodation
train, which in its turn was twenty-five
minutes late. Thirteen minutes afterwards the second
Saugus branch train, which should have preceded,
followed it, being nearly an hour out of time.
Then at last came the Portland express, which got
away practically on time, at a few minutes after
eight o'clock. All of these four trains went out over
the same track as far as the junction at Everett, but
at that point the first and third of the four were to
go off on the branch, while the second and fourth
kept on over the main line. Between these last two
trains the running schedule of the road allowed an
ample time-interval of forty-five minutes, which, however,
on this occasion was reduced, through the delay
in starting, to some fifteen or twenty minutes.
No causes of further delay, therefore, arising, the
simple case was presented of a slow accommodation
train being sent out to run eighteen miles in advance
of a fast express train, with an interval of
twenty minutes between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, the accommodation train
was speedily subjected to another and very serious
delay. It has been mentioned that the Saugus
branch was a single track road, and the rules of the
company were explicit that no outward train was to
pass onto the branch at Everett until any inward
train then due there should have arrived and passed
off it. There was no siding at the junction, upon
which an outward branch train could be temporarily
placed to wait for the inward train, thus leaving the
main track clear; and accordingly, under a strict
construction of the rules, any outward branch train
while awaiting the arrival at Everett of an inward
branch train was to be kept standing on the main
track, completely blocking it. The outward branch
trains, it subsequently appeared, were often delayed
at the junction, but no practical difficulty had arisen
from this cause, as the employé in charge of the signals
and switches there, exercising his common
sense, had been in the custom of moving any delayed
train temporarily out of the way onto the
branch or the other main track, under protection of
a flag, and thus relieving the block. The need of a
siding to permit the passage of trains at this point
had not been felt, simply because the employé in
charge there had used the branch or other main
track as a siding. On the day of the accident this
employé happened to be sick, and absent from his
post. His substitute either had no common sense
or did not feel called upon to use it, if its use involved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
any increase of responsibility. Accordingly,
when a block took place, the simple letter of the
rule was followed;&mdash;and it is almost needless to
add that a block did take place on the afternoon
of August 26th.</p>

<p>The first of the branch trains, it will be remembered,
had left Boston at about seven o'clock, instead
of at 6.30, its schedule time. On arriving at
Everett this train should have met and passed an
inward branch train, which was timed to leave Lynn
at six o'clock, but which, owing to some accident to
its locomotive, and partaking of the general confusion
of the day, on this particular afternoon did not
leave the Lynn station until 7.30 o'clock, or one
hour and a half after its schedule time, and one
half-hour after the other train had left Boston. Accordingly,
when the Boston train reached the junction
its conductor found himself confronted by the
rule forbidding him to enter upon the branch until
the Lynn train then due should have passed off it,
and so he quietly waited on the outward track of
the main line, blocking it completely to traffic. He
had not waited long before a special locomotive, on
its way from Boston to Salem, came up and stopped
behind him. This was presently followed by the
accommodation train. Then the next branch train
came along, and finally the Portland express. At
such a time, and at that period of railroad development,
there was something ludicrous about the spectacle.
Here was a road utterly unable to accommodate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
its passengers with cars, while a succession of
trains were standing idle for hours, because a locomotive
had broken down ten miles off. The telegraph
was there, but the company was not in the
custom of putting any reliance upon it. A simple
message to the branch trains to meet and pass at any
point other than that fixed in the schedule would
have solved the whole difficulty; but, no!&mdash;there
were the rules, and all the rolling stock of the road
might gather at Everett in solemn procession, but,
until the locomotive at Lynn could be repaired, the
law of the Medes and Persians was plain; and in
this case it read that the telegraph was a new-fangled
and unreliable auxiliary. And so the lengthening
procession stood there long enough for the train
which caused it to have gone to its destination and
come back dragging the disabled locomotive from
Lynn behind it to again take its place in the
block.</p>

<p>At last, at about ten minutes after eight o'clock,
the long-expected Lynn train made its appearance,
and the first of the branch trains from Boston immediately
went off the main line. The road was
now clear for the accommodation train, which had
been standing some twelve or fifteen minutes in the
block, but which from the moment of again starting
was running on the schedule time of the Portland express.
This its conductor did not know. Every
minute was vital, and yet he never thought to look
at his watch. He had a vague impression that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
had been delayed some six or eight minutes, when
in reality he had been delayed fifteen; and, though
he was running wholly out of his schedule time, he
took not a single precaution, so persuaded was he
that every one knew where he was.</p>

<p>The confusion among those in charge of the various
engines and trains was, indeed, general and
complete. As the Portland express was about to
leave the Boston station, the superintendent of the
road, knowing by the non-arrival of the branch train
from Lynn that there must be a block at the Everett
junction, had directed the depot-master to caution
the engineer to look out for the trains ahead of him.
The order, a merely verbal one, was delivered after
the train had started, the depot-master walking
along by the side of the slowly-moving locomotive,
and was either incorrectly transmitted or not fully
understood; the engine-driver supposed it to apply
to the branch train which had started just before
him, out of both its schedule time and schedule
place. Presently, at the junction, he was stopped
by the signal man of this train. The course of
reasoning he would then have had to pass through
to divine the true situation of affairs and to guide
himself safely under the schedule in the light of
the running rules was complicated indeed, and somewhat
as follows: "The branch train," he should
have argued to himself, "is stopped, and it is stopped
because the train which should have left Lynn
at six o'clock has not yet arrived; but, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
rules, that train should pass off the branch before
the 6.30 train could pass onto it; if, therefore, the
'wild' train before me is delayed not only the 6.30
but all intermediate trains must likewise be delayed,
and the accommodation train went out this afternoon
after the 6.30 train, so it, too, must be in the
block ahead of me; unless, indeed, as is usually the
case, the signal-master has got it out of the block
under the protection of a flag." This line of reasoning
was, perhaps, too intricate; at any rate, the
engine-driver did not follow it out, but, when he saw
the tail-lights immediately before him disappear on
the branch, he concluded that the main line was now
clear, and dismissed the depot-master's caution from
his mind. Meanwhile, as the engine-driver of this
train was fully persuaded that the only other train
in his front had gone off on the branch, the conductor
of the accommodation train was equally persuaded
that the head-light immediately behind him
in the block at the junction had been that of the
Portland express which consequently should be
aware of his position. Both were wrong.</p>

<p>Thus when they left Everett the express was fairly
chasing the accommodation train, and overtaking it
with terrible rapidity. Even then no collision ought
to have been possible. Unfortunately, however, the
road had no system, even the crudest, of interval
signals; and the utter irregularity prevailing in the
train movement seemed to have demoralized the
employés along the line, who, though they noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the extreme proximity of the two trains to each
other as they passed various points, all sluggishly
took it for granted that those in charge of them
were fully aware of their relative positions and
knew what they were about. Thus, as the two
trains approached the Revere station, they were
so close together as to be on the same piece of
straight track at the same time, and a passenger
standing at the rear end of the accommodation
train distinctly saw the head-light of the express
locomotive. The night, however, was not a clear
one, for an east wind had prevailed all day, driving
a mist in from the sea which lay in banks over
the marshes, lifting at times so that distant objects
were quite visible, and then obscuring them in
its heavy folds. Consequently it did not at all follow,
because the powerful reflecting head-light of
the locomotive was visible from the accommodation
train, that the dim tail-lights of the latter were also
visible to those on the locomotive. Here was another
mischance. The tail-lights in use by the company
were ordinary red lanterns without reflecting
power.</p>

<p>The station house at Revere stood at the end of
a tangent, the track curving directly before it. In
any ordinary weather the tail-lights of a train standing
at this station would have been visible for a very
considerable distance down the track in the direction
of Boston, and even on the night of the accident
they were probably visible for a sufficient distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
in which to stop any train approaching at a
reasonable rate of speed. Unfortunately the engineer
of the Portland express did not at once see
them, his attention being wholly absorbed in looking
for other signals. Certain freight train tracks to
points on the shore diverged from the main line at
Revere, and the engine-drivers of all trains approaching
that place were notified by signals at a masthead
close to the station whether the switches were set
for the main line or for these freight tracks. A red
lantern at the masthead indicated that the main line
was closed; in the absence of any signal it was
open. In looking for this signal as he approached
Revere the engine-driver of the Portland express was
simply attending closely to his business, for, had the
red light been at the masthead, his train must at
once have been stopped. Unfortunately, however,
while peering through the mist at the masthead he
overlooked what was directly before him, until, when
at last he brought his eyes down to the level, to use
his own words at the subsequent inquest, "the tail
lights of the accommodation train seemed to spring
right up in his face."</p>

<p>When those in charge of the two trains at almost
the same moment became aware of the danger, there
was yet an interval of some eight hundred feet between
them. The express train was, however, moving
at a speed of some twenty-five or thirty miles an
hour, and was equipped only with the old-fashioned
hand-brake. In response to the sharply given signal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
from the whistle these were rapidly set, but the rails
were damp and slippery, so that the wheels failed to
catch upon them, and, when everything was done
which could be done, the eight hundred feet of interval
sufficed only to reduce the speed of the colliding
locomotive to about ten miles an hour.</p>

<p>In the rear car of the accommodation train there
were at the moment of the accident some sixty-five
or seventy human beings, seated and standing. They
were of both sexes and of all ages; for it was a
Saturday evening in August, and many persons had,
through the confusion of the trains, been long delayed
in their return from the city to their homes at
the sea-side. The first intimation the passengers
had of the danger impending over them was from
the sudden and lurid illumination of the car by the
glare from the head-light of the approaching locomotive.
One of them who survived the disaster,
though grievously injured, described how
he was carelessly watching a young man standing
in the aisle, laughing and gayly chatting
with four young girls, who were seated, when
he saw him turn and instantly his face, in the
sudden blaze of the head-light, assumed a look
of frozen horror which was the single thing in the
accident indelibly impressed on the survivor's memory;
that look haunted him. The car was crowded
to its full capacity, and the colliding locomotive
struck it with such force as to bury itself two-thirds
of its length in it. At the instant of the crash a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
panic had seized upon the passengers, and a sort of
rush had taken place to the forward end of the car,
into which furniture, fixtures and human beings
were crushed in a shapeless, indistinguishable mass.
Meanwhile the blow had swept away the smoke-stack
of the locomotive, and its forward truck had
been forced back in some unaccountable way until
it rested between its driving wheels and the tender,
leaving the entire boiler inside of the passenger car
and supported on its rear truck. The valves had
been so broken as to admit of the free escape of
the scalding steam, while the coals from the fire-box
were scattered among the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i>, and coming in
contact with the fluid from the broken car lamps
kindled the whole into a rapid blaze. Neither was
the fire confined to the last car of the train. It has
been mentioned that in the block at Everett a locomotive
returning to Salem had found itself stopped
just in advance of the accommodation train. At
the suggestion of the engine-driver of that train this
locomotive had there coupled on to it, and consequently
made a part of it at Revere. When the
collision took place, therefore, the four cars of which
the accommodation train was made up were crushed
between the weight of the entire colliding train
on one side and that of two locomotives on the
other. That they were not wholly demolished was
due simply to the fact that the last car yielded to
the blow, and permitted the locomotive of the express
train fairly to imbed itself in it. As it was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the remaining cars were jammed and shattered, and,
though the passengers in them escaped, the oil from
the broken lamps ignited, and before the flames
could be extinguished the cars were entirely destroyed.</p>

<p>This accident resulted in the death of twenty-nine
persons, and in more or less severe injuries to fifty-seven
others. No person, not in the last car of the
accommodation train was killed, and one only was
seriously injured. Of those in the last car more
than half lost their lives; many instantly by crushing,
others by inhaling the scalding steam which
poured forth from the locomotive boiler into the
wreck, and which, where it did not kill, inflicted
frightful injuries. Indeed, for the severity of injuries
and for the protractedness of agony involved
in it, this accident has rarely, if ever, been exceeded.
Crushing, scalding and burning did their work together.</p>

<p>It may with perfect truth be said that the disaster
at Revere marked an epoch in the history of
railroad development in New England. At the
moment it called forth the deepest expression of
horror and indignation, which, as usual in such
cases, was more noticeable for its force than for its
wisdom. An utter absence of all spirit of justice
is, indeed, a usual characteristic of the more immediate
utterances, both from the press and on the
platform, upon occasions of this character. Writers
and orators seem always to forget that, next to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
immediate sufferers and their families, the unfortunate
officials concerned are the greatest losers by
railroad accidents. For them, not only reputation
but bread is involved. A railroad employé implicated
in the occurrence of an accident lives under
a stigma. And yet, from the tenor of public comment
it might fairly be supposed that these officials
are in the custom of plotting to bring disasters
about, and take a fiendish delight in them.
Nowhere was this ever illustrated more perfectly
than in Massachusetts during the last days of
August and the early days of September, 1871.
Grave men&mdash;men who ought to have known
better&mdash;indulged in language which would have
been simply ludicrous save for the horror of the
event which occasioned but could not justify it.
A public meeting, for instance, was held at the
town of Swampscott on the evening of the Monday
succeeding the catastrophe. The gentleman who
presided over it very discreetly, in his preliminary
remarks, urged those who proposed to join in the
discussion to control their feelings. Hardly had he
ceased speaking, however, when Mr. Wendell Phillips
was noticed among the audience, and immediately
called to the platform. His remarks were a
most singular commentary on the chairman's injunction
to calmness. He began by announcing
that the first requisite to the formation of a healthy
public opinion in regard to railroad accidents, as
other things, was absolute frankness of speech, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
he then proceeded as follows:&mdash;"So I begin by saying
that to my mind this terrible disaster, which has
made the last thirty-six hours so sad to us all, is a
deliberate murder. I think we should try to get
rid in the public mind of any real distinction between
the individual who, in a moment of passion
or in a moment of heedlessness, takes the life of one
fellow-man, and the corporation that in a moment
of greed, of little trouble, of little expense, of little
care, of little diligence, takes lives by wholesale. I
think the first requisite of the public mind is to say
that there is no accident in the case, properly speaking.
It is a murder; the guilt of murder rests somewhere."</p>

<p>Mr. Phillip's definition of the crime of "deliberate
murder" would apparently somewhat unsettle the
criminal law as at present understood, but he was
not at all alone in this bathos of extravagance.
Prominent gentlemen seemed to vie with each other
in their display of ignorance. Mr. B. F. Butler, for
instance, suggested his view of the disaster and the
measure best calculated to prevent a repetition of it;
which last was certainly original, inasmuch as he
urged the immediate raising of the pay of all engine-men
until a sufficiently high order of ability and education
should be brought into the occupation to render
impossible the recurrence of an accident which
was primarily caused by the negligence, not of an
engineer, but of a conductor. Another gentleman
described with much feeling his observations during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
a recent tour in Europe, and declared that such a
catastrophe as that at Revere would have been impossible
there. As a matter of fact the official reports
not only showed that the accident was one of
a class of most frequent occurrence, but also that
sixty-one cases of it had occurred in Great Britain
alone during the very year the gentleman in question
was journeying in Europe, and had occasioned
over six hundred cases of death or personal injury.
Perhaps, in order to illustrate how very reckless in
statement a responsible gentleman talking under excitement
may become, it is worth while to quote in
his own language Captain Tyler's brief description of
one of those sixty-one accidents which "could not
possibly," but yet did, occur. As miscellaneous
reading it is amusing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As four London &amp; North-Western excursion trains
on September 2, 1870, were returning from a volunteer
review at Penrith, the fourth came into collision at Penruddock
with the third of those trains. An hundred
and ten passengers and three servants of the company
were injured. These trains were partly in charge of
acting guards, some of whom were entirely inexperienced,
as well in the line as in their duties; and of engine-drivers
and firemen, of whom one, at all events, was very
much the worse for liquor. The side-lamps on the hind
van of the third train were obscured by a horse-box,
which was wider than the van. There were no special
means of protection to meet the exceptional contingency
of three such trains all stopping on their way from the
eastward, to cross two others from the westward, at this
station. And the regulations for telegraphing the trains
were altogether neglected."</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>REAR END COLLISIONS.</h3>


<p>The annals of railroad accidents are full of cases
of "rear-end collision," as it is termed.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Their frequency
may almost be accepted as a very accurate
gauge of the pressure of traffic on any given system
of lines, and because of them the companies are continually
compelled to adopt new and more intricate
systems of operation. At first, on almost all roads,
trains follow each other at such great intervals that
no precaution at all, other than flags and lanterns,
are found necessary. Then comes a succeeding period
when an interval of time between following trains is
provided for, through a system of signals which at
given points indicate danger during a certain number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of minutes after the passage of every train.
Then, presently, the alarming frequency of rear collisions
demonstrates the inadequacy of this system,
and a new one has to be devised, which, through the
aid of electricity, secures between the trains an interval
of space as well as of time. This last is known
as the "block-system," of which so much has of
late years been heard.</p>

<p>The block-system is so important a feature in the
modern operation of railroads, and in its present
stage of development it illustrates so strikingly the
difference between the European and the American
methods, that more particular reference will have
presently to be made to it.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> For the present it is
enough to say that rear-end collisions occur notwithstanding
all the precautions implied in a thoroughly
perfected "block-system." There was such a case
on the Metropolitan road, in the very heart of London,
on the 29th of August, 1873. It happened in
a tunnel. A train was stalled there, and an unfortunate
signal officer in a moment of flurry gave
"line clear" and sent another train directly into it.</p>

<p>A much more impressive disaster, both in its dramatic
features and as illustrating the inadequacy
of every precaution depending on human agency to
avert accident under certain conditions, was afforded
in the case of a collision which occurred on the
London &amp; Brighton Railway on August 25, 1861;
ten years almost to a day before that at Revere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Like the Eastern railroad, the London &amp; Brighton
enjoyed an enormous passenger traffic, which became
peculiarly heavy during the vacation season
towards the close of August; and it was to the
presence of the excursion trains made necessary to
accomodate this traffic that the catastrophes were
in both cases due. In the case of the London &amp;
Brighton road it occurred on a Sunday. An excursion
train from Portsmouth on that day was to
leave Brighton at five minutes after eight <small>A. M.</small>, and
was to be followed by a regular Sunday excursion
train at 8.15 or ten minutes later, and that again,
after the lapse of a quarter of an hour, by a regular
parliamentary train at 8.30. These trains were certainly
timed to run sufficiently near to each other;
but, owing to existing pressure of traffic on the line,
they started almost simultaneously. The Portsmouth
excursion, which consisted of sixteen carriages,
was much behind its time, and did not leave
the Brighton station until 8.28; when, after a lapse
of three minutes, it was followed by the regular excursion
train at 8.31, and that again by the parliamentary
train at 8.35. Three passenger trains had
thus left the station on one track in seven minutes!
The London and Brighton Railway traverses the
chalky downs, for which that portion of England is
noted, through numerous tunnels, the first of which
after leaving Brighton is known as the Patcham
Tunnel, about five hundred yards in length, while
two and a half miles farther on is the Croydon Tunnel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
rather more than a mile and a quarter in length.</p>

<p>The line between these tunnels was so crooked
and obscured that the managers had adopted extraordinary
precautions against accident. At each end
of the Croydon Tunnel a signal-man was stationed,
with a telegraphic apparatus, a clock and a telegraph
bell in his station. The rule was absolute that when
any train entered the tunnel the signal-man at the
point of entry was to telegraph "train in," and no
other train could follow until the return signal of
"train out" came from the other side. In face of
such a regulation it was difficult to see how any collision
in the tunnel was possible. When the Portsmouth
excursion train arrived, it at once entered the
tunnel and the fact was properly signaled to the opposite
outlet. Before the return signal that this
train was out was received, the regular excursion
train came in sight. It should have been stopped
by a self-acting signal which was placed about a
quarter of a mile from the mouth of the tunnel, and
which each passing locomotive set at "danger,"
where it remained until shifted to "safety," by the
signal-man, on receipt of the message, "train out."
Through some unexplained cause, the Portsmouth
excursion train had failed to act on this signal, which
consequently still indicated safety when the Brighton
excursion train came up. Accordingly the engine-driver
at once passed it, and went on to the tunnel.
As he did so, the signal-man, perceiving some mistake
and knowing that he had not yet got his return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
signal that the preceding train was out, tried to
stop him by waving his red flag. It was too late,
however, and the train passed in. A moment later
the parliamentary train also came in sight, and stopped
at the signal of danger. Now ensued a most
singular misapprehension between the signal-men,
resulting in a terrible disaster. The second train
had run into the tunnel and was supposed by the
signal-man to be on its way to the other end of it,
when he received the return message that the first
train was out. To this he instantly responded by
again telegraphing "train in," referring now to the
second train. This dispatch the signal-man at the
opposite end conceived to be a repetition of the
message referring to the first train, and he accordingly
again replied that the train was out. This reply,
however, the other operator mistook as referring
to the second train, and accordingly he signaled
"safety," and the third train at once got under way
and passed into the tunnel. Unfortunately the engineer
of the second train had seen the red flag
waved by the signal-man, and, in obedience to it,
stopped his locomotive as soon as possible in the
tunnel and began to back out of it. In doing so, he
drove his train into the locomotive of the third train
advancing into it. The tunnel was twenty-four feet
in height. The engine of the parliamentary train
struck the rear carriage of the excursion train and
mounted upon its fragments, and then on those of
the carriage in front of it, until its smoke-stack came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
in contact with the roof of the tunnel. It rested
finally in a nearly upright position. The collision
had taken place so far within the tunnel as to be beyond
the reach of daylight, and the wreck of the
trains had quite blocked up the arch, while the steam
and smoke from the engines poured forth with loud
sound and in heavy volumes, filling the empty space
with stifling and scalding vapors. When at last assistance
came and the trains could be separated,
twenty-three corpses were taken from the ruins,
while one hundred and seventy-six other persons
had sustained more or less severe injuries.</p>

<p>A not less extraordinary accident of the same
description, unaccompanied, however, by an equal
loss of life, occured on the Great Northern Railway
upon the 10th of June, 1866. In this case the tube
of a locomotive of a freight train burst at about the
centre of the Welwyn Tunnel, some five miles north
of Hatfield, bringing the train to a stand-still. The
guard in charge of the rear of the train failed from
some cause to go back and give the signal for an
obstruction, and speedily another freight train from
the Midland road entered and dashed into the rear
of the train already there. Apparently those in
charge of these two trains were in such consternation
that they did not think to provide against a
further disaster; at any rate, before measures to
that end had been taken, an additional freight train,
this time belonging to the Great Northern road,
came up and plowed into the ruins which already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
blocked the tunnel. One of the trains had contained
wagons laden with casks of oil, which speedily
became ignited from contact with the coals scattered
from the fire-boxes, and there then ensued one of
the most extraordinary spectacles ever witnessed on
a railroad. The tunnel was filled to the summit of
its arch and completely blocked with the wrecked
locomotives and wagons. These had ignited, and
the whole cavity, more than a half a mile in length,
was converted into one huge furnace, belching forth
smoke and flame with a loud roaring sound through
its several air shafts. So fierce was the fire that
no attempt was made to subdue it, and eighteen
hours elapsed before any steps could be taken towards
clearing the track. Strange to say, in this
disaster the lives of but two persons were lost.</p>

<p>Rear-end collisions have been less frequent in this
country than in England, for the simple reason that
the volume of traffic has pressed less heavily on the
capacity of the lines. Yet here, also, they have been
by no means unknown. In 1865 two occurred, both
of which were accompanied with a considerable loss
of life; though, coming as they did during the exciting
scenes which marked the close of the war of
the Rebellion, they attracted much less public
notice than they otherwise would. The first of
these took place in New Jersey on the 7th of March,
1865, just three days after the second inauguration
of President Lincoln. As the express train from
Washington to New York over the Camden &amp; Amboy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
road was passing through Bristol, about thirty
miles from Philadelphia, at half-past-two o'clock in
the morning, it dashed into the rear of the twelve
o'clock "owl train," from Kensington to New York,
which had been delayed by meeting an oil train on
the track before it. The case appears to have been
one of very culpable negligence, for, though the owl
train was some two hours late, those in charge of it
seem to have been so deeply engrossed in what was
going on before them that they wholly neglected to
guard their rear. The express train accordingly,
approaching around a curve, plunged at a high rate
of speed into the last car, shattering it to pieces;
the engine is even said to have passed completely
through that car and to have imbedded itself in
the one before it. It so happened that most of the
sufferers by this accident, numbering about fifty,
were soldiers on their way home from the army
upon furlough.</p>

<p>The second of the two disasters referred to, occurred
on the 16th of August, 1865, upon the
Housatonic road of Connecticut. A new engine was
out upon an experimental trip, and in rounding
a curve it ran into the rear of a passenger train,
which, having encountered a disabled freight train,
had coupled on to it and was then backing down
with it to a siding in order to get by. In this
case the impetus was so great that the colliding
locomotive utterly destroyed the rear car of the
passenger train and penetrated some distance into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the car preceding it, where its boiler burst. Fortunately
the train was by no means full of passengers;
but, even as it was, eleven persons were killed
and some seventeen badly injured.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>NOVEL APPLIANCES.</h3>


<p>The great peculiarity of the Revere accident, and
that which gave a permanent interest to it, lay in the
revelation it afforded of the degree in which a system
had outgrown its appliances. At every point
a deficiency was apparent. The railroads of New
England had long been living on their early reputation,
and now, when a sudden test was applied, it
was found that they were years behind the time.
In August, 1871, the Eastern railroad was run as if
it were a line of stage-coaches in the days before the
telegraph. Not in one point alone, but in everything,
it broke down under the test. The disaster
was due not to any single cause but to a combination
of causes implicating not only the machinery
and appliances in use by the company, but its discipline
and efficiency from the highest official down
to the meanest subordinate. In the first place the
capacity of the road was taxed to the utmost; it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
vital, almost, that every wheel should be kept in
motion. Yet, under that very exigency, the wheels
stopped almost as a matter of necessity. How could
it be otherwise?&mdash;Here was a crowded line, more
than half of which was equipped with but a single
track, in operating which no reliance was placed
upon the telegraph. With trains running out of
their schedule time and out of their schedule place,
engineers and conductors were left to grope their
way along as best they could in the light of rules,
the essence of which was that when in doubt they
were to stand stock still. Then, in the absence
of the telegraph, a block occurred almost at the
mouth of the terminal station; and there the trains
stood for hours in stupid obedience to a stupid
rule, because the one man who, with a simple regard
to the dictates of common sense, was habitually
accustomed to violate it happened to be sick.
Trains commonly left a station out of time and out
of place; and the engineer of an express train was
sent out to run a gauntlet the whole length of the
road with a simple verbal injunction to look out for
some one before him. Then, at last, when this express
train through all this chaos got to chasing an
accommodation train, much as a hound might course
a hare, there was not a pretence of a signal to indicate
the time which had elapsed between the passage
of the two, and employés, lanterns in hand,
gaped on in bewilderment at the awful race, concluding
that they could not at any rate do anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to help matters, but on the whole they were inclined
to think that those most immediately concerned
must know what they were about. Finally, even
when the disaster was imminent, when deficiency in
organization and discipline had done its worst, its
consequences might yet have been averted through
the use of better appliances; had the one train been
equipped with the Westinghouse brake, already
largely in use in other sections of the country, it
might and would have been stopped; or had the
other train been provided with reflecting tail-lights
in place of the dim hand-lanterns which glimmered
on its rear platform, it could hardly have failed to
make its proximity known. Any one of a dozen
things, every one of which should have been but was
not, ought to have averted the disaster. Obviously
its immediate cause was not far to seek. It lay in
the carelessness of a conductor who failed to consult
his watch, and never knew until the crash came that
his train was leisurely moving along on the time of
another. Nevertheless, what can be said in extenuation
of a system under which, at this late day, a railroad
is operated on the principle that each employé
under all circumstances can and will take care of himself
and of those whose lives and limbs are entrusted
to his care?</p>

<p>There is, however, another and far more attractive
side to the picture. The lives sacrificed at
Revere were not lost in vain. Seven complete railroad
years passed by between that and the Wollaston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Heights accident of 1878. During that time
not less than two hundred and thirty millions of
persons were carried by rail within the limits of
Massachusetts. Of this vast number while only 50,
or about one in each four and a half millions, sustained
any injury from causes beyond their own
power to control, the killed were just two. This
certainly was a record with which no community
could well find fault; and it was due more than
anything else to the great disaster of August 26,
1871. More than once, and on more than one
road, accidents occurred which, but for the improved
appliances introduced in consequence of the
experience at Revere, could hardly have failed of
fatal results. Not that these appliances were in
all cases very cheerfully or very eagerly accepted.
Neither the Miller platform nor the Westinghouse
brake won its way into general use unchallenged.
Indeed, the earnestness and even the indignation
with which presidents and superintendents then
protested that their car construction was better and
stronger than Miller's; that their antiquated handbrakes
were the most improved brakes,&mdash;better,
much better, than the Westinghouse; that their
crude old semaphores and targets afforded a protection
to trains which no block-system would ever
equal,&mdash;all this certainly was comical enough, even in
the very shadow of the great tragedy. Men of a certain
type always have protested and will always continue
to protest that they have nothing to learn;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
yet, under the heavy burden of responsibility, learn
they still do. They dare not but learn. On this
point the figures of the Massachusetts annual returns
between the year 1871 and the year 1878
speak volumes. At the time of the Revere disaster,
with one single honorable exception,&mdash;that of the
Boston &amp; Providence road,&mdash;both the atmospheric
train-brake and the Miller platform, the two greatest
modern improvements in American car construction,
were practically unrecognized on the railroads
of Massachusetts. Even a year later, but 93 locomotives
and 415 cars had been equipped even with
the train-brake. In September, 1873, the number
had, however, risen to 194 locomotives and 709 cars;
and another twelve months carried these numbers
up to 313 locomotives and 997 cars. Finally in
1877 the state commissioners in their report for
that year spoke of the train-brake as having been
then generally adopted, and at the same time called
attention to the very noticeable fact "that the only
railroad accident resulting in the death of a passenger
from causes beyond his control within the state
during a period of two years and eight months, was
caused by the failure of a company to adopt this
improvement on all its passenger rolling-stock."
The adoption of Miller's method of car construction
had meanwhile been hardly less rapid. Almost
unknown at the time of the Revere catastrophe in
September, 1871, in October, 1873, when returns on
the subject were first called for by the state commissioners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
eleven companies had already adopted
it on 778 cars out of a total number of 1548 reported.
In 1878 it had been adopted by twenty-two
companies, and applied to 1685 cars out of a
total of 1792. In other words it had been brought
into general use.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>THE AUTOMATIC ELECTRIC BLOCK SYSTEM.</h3>


<p>A realizing sense of the necessity of ultimately
adopting some system of protection against the
danger of rear-end collisions was, above all else,
brought directly home to American railroad managers
through the Revere disaster. In discussing and
comparing the appliances used in the practical operation
of railroads in different countries, there is one
element, however, which can never be left out of
the account. The intelligence, quickness of perception
and capacity for taking care of themselves&mdash;that
combination of qualities which, taken together,
constitute individuality and adaptability
to circumstance&mdash;vary greatly among the railroad
employés of different countries. The American
locomotive engineer, as he is called, is especially
gifted in this way. He can be relied on to take care
of himself and his train under circumstances which
in other countries would be thought to insure disaster.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Volumes on this point were included in the fact
that though at the time of the Revere disaster many
of the American lines, especially in Massachusetts,
were crowded with the trains of a mixed traffic, the
necessity of making any provision against rear-end
collisions, further than by directing those in immediate
charge of the trains to keep a sharp look out
and to obey their printed orders, seemed hardly to
have occurred to any one. The English block system
was now and then referred to in a vague, general
way; but it was very questionable whether one
in ten of those referring to it knew anything about
it or had ever seen it in operation, much less investigated
it. A characteristic illustration of this
was afforded in the course of those official investigations
which followed the Revere disaster, and
have already more than once been alluded to. Prior
to that disaster the railroads of Massachusetts
had, as a rule, enjoyed a rather exceptional freedom
from accidents, and there was every reason
to suppose that their regulations were as exact
and their system as good as those in use in other
parts of the country. Yet it then appeared that
in the rules of very few of the Massachusetts roads
had any provision, even of the simplest character,
been made as to the effect of telegraphic orders,
or the course to be pursued by employés in charge
of trains on their receipt. The appliances for
securing intervals between following trains were
marked by a quaint simplicity. They were, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
"singularly primitive," as the railroad commissioners
on a subsequent occasion described them, when
it appeared that on one of the principal roads of the
state the interval between two closely following
trains was signalled to the engineer of the second
train by a station-master's holding up to him as he
passed a number of fingers corresponding to the
number of minutes since the first train had gone
by. For the rest the examination revealed, as the
nearest approach to a block system, a queer collection
of dials, sand-glasses, green flags, colored lanterns
and hand-targets. The climax in the course
of that investigation was, however, reached when
some reference, involving a description of it, was
made to the English block. This was met by a
protest on the part of one veteran superintendent,
who announced that it might work well under
certain circumstances, but for himself he could
not be responsible for the operation of a road
running the number of trains he had charge of in
reliance on any such system. The subject, in fact,
was one of which he knew absolutely nothing;&mdash;not
even that, through the block system and
through it alone, fourteen trains were habitually
and safely moved under circumstances where he
moved one. This occurred in 1871, and though
eight years have since elapsed information in regard
to the block system is not yet very widely disseminated
inside of railroad circles, much less outside
of them. It is none the less a necessity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
future. It has got to be understood, and, in some
form, it has got to be adopted; for even in America
there are limits to the reliance which, when the
lives and limbs of many are at stake, can be placed
on the "sharp look out" of any class of men, no
matter how intelligent they may be.</p>

<p>The block system is of English origin, and it
scarcely needs to be said that it was adopted by the
railroad corporations of that country only when they
were driven to it by the exigencies of their traffic.
But for that system, indeed, the most costly portion
of the tracks of the English roads must of necessity
have been duplicated years ago, as their traffic
had fairly outgrown those appliances of safety
which have even to this time been found sufficient
in America. There were points, for instance, where
two hundred and seventy regular trains of one line
alone passed daily. On the London &amp; North-Western
there are more than sixty through down
trains, taking no account of local trains, each day
passing over the same line of tracks, among which
are express trains which stop nowhere, way trains
which stop everywhere, express-freight, way-freight,
mineral trains and parcel trains. On the Midland
road there are nearly twice as many similar trains on
each track. On the Metropolitan railway the average
interval is three and one-third minutes between
trains. In one case points were mentioned where 270
regular trains of one line alone passed a given junction
during each twenty-four hours,&mdash;where 470 trains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
passed a single station, the regular interval between
them being but five-eighths of a mile,&mdash;where 132
trains entered and left a single station during three
hours of each evening every day, being one train in
eighty-two seconds. In 1870 there daily reached or
left the six stations of the Boston roads some 385
trains; while no less than 650 trains a day were in the
same year received and despatched from a single one
of the London stations. On one single exceptional
occasion 1,111 trains, carrying 145,000 persons,
were reported as entering and leaving this station
in the space of eighteen hours, being rather more
than a train a minute. Indeed it may well be questioned
whether the world anywhere else furnishes an
illustration so apt and dramatic of the great mechanical
achievements of recent times as that to be
seen during the busy hours of any week-day from
the signal and interlocking galleries which span the
tracks as they enter the Charing Cross or Cannon
street stations in London. Below and in front of
the galleries the trains glide to and fro, coming suddenly
into sight from beyond the bridges and as
suddenly disappearing,&mdash;winding swiftly in and out,
and at times four of them running side by side on
as many tracks but in both directions,&mdash;the whole
making up a swiftly shifting maze of complex movement
under the influence of which a head unaccustomed
to the sight grows actually giddy. Yet it is
all done so quietly and smoothly, with such an absence
of haste and nervousness on the part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
stolid operators in charge, that it is not easy to decide
which most to wonder at, the almost inconceivable
magnitude and despatch of the train-movement
or the perfection of the appliances which make
it possible. No man concerned in the larger management
of railroads, who has not passed a morning in
those London galleries, knows what it is to handle
a great city's traffic.</p>

<p>Perfect as it is in its way, however, it may well be
questioned whether the block system as developed
in England is likely to be generally adopted on
American railroads. Upon one or two of them, and
notably on the New Jersey Central and a division
of the Pennsylvania, it has already been in use for
a number of years. From an American point of
view, however, it is open to a number of objections.
That in itself it is very perfect and has been successfully
elaborated so as to provide for almost every
possible contingency is proved by the results daily
accomplished by means of it.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The English lines
are made to do an incredible amount of work with
comparative few accidents. The block system is,
however, none the less a very clumsy and complicated
one, necessitating the constant employment
of a large number of skilled operators. Here is the
great defect in it from the American point of view.
In this country labor is scarce and capital costly.
The effort is always towards the perfecting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
labor-saving machines. Hitherto the pressure of
traffic on the lines has not been greater than could
be fairly controlled by simpler appliances, and the
expense of the English system is so heavy that its
adoption, except partially, would not have been
warranted. As Barry says in his treatise on the subject,
"one can 'buy gold too dear'; for if every
possible known precaution is to be taken, regardless
of cost, it may not pay to work a railway at all."</p>

<p>It is tolerably safe, therefore, to predict that the
American block system of the future will be essentially
different from the present English system.
The basis&mdash;electricity&mdash;will of course be the same;
but, while the operator is everywhere in the English
block, his place will be supplied to the utmost possible
degree by automatic action in the American. It
is in this direction that the whole movement since
the Revere disaster has been going on, and the advance
has been very great. From peculiarities of
condition also the American block must be made to
cover a multitude of weak points in the operation of
roads, and give timely notice of dangers against
which the English block provides only to a limited
degree, and always through the presence of yet
other employés. For instance, as will presently
be seen, many more accidents and, in Europe even,
far greater loss of life is caused by locomotives
coming in contact with vehicles at points where
highways cross railroad tracks at a level therewith
than by rear-end collisions; meanwhile throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
America, even in the most crowded suburban neighborhoods,
these crossings are the rule, whereas in
Europe they are the exception. The English block
affords protection against this danger by giving
electric notice to gatemen; but gatemen are always
supposed. So also as respects the movements
of passengers in and about stations in crossing
tracks as they come to or leave the trains, or prepare
to take their places in them. The rule in
Europe is that passenger crossings at local stations
are provided over or under the tracks; in America,
however, almost nowhere is any provision at
all made, but passengers, men, women and children,
are left to scramble across tracks as best they can
in the face of passing trains. They are expected
to take care of themselves, and the success with
which they do it is most astonishing. Having been
brought up to this self-care all their lives, they do
not, as would naturally be supposed, become confused
and stumble under the wheels of locomotives;
and the statistics seem to show that no more accidents
from this cause occur in America than in
Europe. Nevertheless some provision is manifestly
desirable to notify employés as well as passengers
that trains are approaching, especially where way-stations
are situated on curves.</p>

<p>Again, it is well known that, next to collisions, the
greatest source of danger to railroad trains is due
to broken tracks. It is, of course, apparent that
tracks may at any time be broken by accident, as by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
earth-slides, derailment or the fracture of rails. This
danger has to be otherwise provided for; the block
has nothing to do with it further than to prevent a
train delayed by any such break from being run into
by any following train. The broken track which the
perfect block should give notice of is that where the
break is a necessary incident to the regular operation
of the road. It is these breaks which, both in America
and elsewhere, are the fruitful source of the
great majority of railroad accidents, and draw-bridges
and switches, or facing points as they are termed in
the English reports, are most prominent among
them. Wherever there is a switch, the chances are
that in the course of time there will be an accident.</p>

<p>Four matters connected with train movement
have now been specified, in regard to which some
provision is either necessary or highly desirable:
these are rear collisions, tracks broken at draw-bridges
or at switches, highway grade crossings,
and the notification of agents and passengers at
stations. The effort in America, somewhat in advance
of that crowded condition of the lines which
makes the adoption of something a measure of present
necessity, has been directed towards the invention
of an automatic system which at one and the
same time should cover all the dangers and provide
for all the needs which have been referred to, eliminating
the risks incident to human forgetfulness,
drowsiness and weakness of nerves. Can reliable
automatic provision thus be made?&mdash;The English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
authorities are of opinion that it cannot. They insist
that "if automatic arrangements be adopted,
however suitable they may be to the duties which
they have to perform, they should in all cases be
used as additions to, and not as substitutions for,
safety machinery worked by competent signal-men.
The signal-man should be bound to exercise his observation,
care and judgment, and to act thereon;
and the machine, as far as possible, be such that if
he attempts to go wrong it shall check him."</p>

<p>It certainly cannot be said that the American
electrician has as yet demonstrated the incorrectness
of this conclusion, but he has undoubtedly
made a good deal of progress in that direction. Of
the various automatic blocks which have now been
experimented with or brought into practice, the Hall
Electric and the Union Safety Signal Company systems
have been developed to a very marked degree
of perfection. They depend for their working on
diametrically opposite principles: the Hall signals
being worked by means of an electric circuit caused
by the action of wheels moving on the rails, and
conveyed through the usual medium of wires;
while, under the other system, the wires being
wholly dispensed with, a continuous electric circuit
is kept up by means of the rails, which
are connected for the purpose, and the signals are
then acted upon through the breaking of this normal
circuit by the movement of locomotives and
cars. So far as the signals are concerned, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
no essential difference between the two systems,
except that Hall supplies the necessary motive
force by the direct action of electricity, while in
the other case dependence is placed upon suspended
weights. Of the two the Hall system is the oldest
and most thoroughly elaborated, having been compelled
to pass through that long and useful tentative
process common to all inventions, during
which they are regarded as of doubtful utility and
are gradually developed through a succession of
partial failures. So far as Hall's system is concerned
this period may now fairly be regarded as
over, for it is in established use on a number of the
more crowded roads of the North, and especially
of New England, while the imperfections necessarily
incident to the development of an appliance
at once so delicate and so complicated, have for
certain purposes been clearly overcome. Its signal
arrangements, for instance, to protect draw-bridges,
stations and grade-crossings are wholly distinct from
its block system, through which it provides against
dangers from collision and broken tracks. So far
as draw-bridges are concerned, the protection it affords
is perfect. Not only is its interlocking apparatus
so designed that the opening of the draw
blocks all approach to it, but the signals are also
reciprocal; and if through carelessness or automatic
derangement any train passes the block, the draw-tender
is notified at once of the fact in ample time
to stop it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>In the case of a highway crossing at a level, the
electric bell under Hall's system is placed at the
crossing, giving notice of the approaching train
from the moment it is within half a mile until it
passes; so that, where this appliance is in use,
accidents can happen only through the gross carelessness
of those using the highway. When the
electric bell is silent there is no train within half
a mile and the crossing is safe; it is not safe while
the bell is ringing. As it now stands the law
usually provides that the prescribed signals, either
bell or whistle, shall be given from the locomotive
as it approaches the highway, and at a fixed distance
from it. The signal, therefore, is given at a
distance of several hundred yards, more or less,
from the point of danger. The electric system improves
on this by placing the signal directly at the
point of danger,&mdash;the traveller approaches the bell,
instead of the bell approaching the traveller. At
any point of crossing which is really dangerous,&mdash;that
is at any crossing where trees or cuttings or
buildings mask the railroad from the highway,&mdash;this
distinction is vital. In the one case notice
of the unseen danger must be given and cannot be
unobserved; in the other case whether it is really
given or not may depend on the condition of the
atmosphere or the direction of the wind.</p>

<p>Usually, however, in New England the level
crossings of the more crowded thoroughfares, perhaps
one in ten of the whole number, are protected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
by gates or flag-men. Under similar circumstances
in Great Britain there is an electric connection
between a bell in the cabin of the gate-keeper and
the nearest signal boxes of the block system on
each side of the crossing, so that due notice is
given of the approach of trains from either direction.
In this country it has heretofore been the
custom to warn gate-keepers by the locomotive
whistle, to the intense annoyance of all persons
dwelling near the crossing, or to make them depend
for notice on their own eyes. Under the Hall
system, however, the gate-keeper is automatically
signalled to be on the look out, if he is attending
to his duty; or, if he is neglecting it, the electric
bell in some degree supplies his place, without releasing
the corporation from its liability. In America
the heavy fogs of England are almost unknown,
and the brilliant head lights, heavy bells and shrill
high whistles in use on the locomotives would at
night, it might be supposed, give ample notice to
the most careless of an approaching train. Continually
recurring experience shows, however, that
this is not the case. Under these circumstances
the electric bell at the crossing becomes not only a
matter of justice almost to the employé who is
stationed there, but a watchman over him.</p>

<p>This, however, like the other forms of signals
which have been referred to, is, in the electric system,
a mere adjunct of its chief use, which is the
block,&mdash;they are all as it were things thrown into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the bargain. As contradistinguished from the
English block, which insures only an unoccupied
track, the automatic blocks seek to insure an unbroken
track as well,&mdash;that is not only is each segment
into which a road is divided, protected as respects
following trains by, in the case of Hall's
system, double signals watching over each other,
the one at safety, the other at danger,&mdash;both having
to combine to open the block,&mdash;but every switch or
facing point, the throwing of which may break the
main track, is also protected. The Union Signal
Company's system it is claimed goes still further
than this and indicates any break in the track, though
due to accidental fracture or displacement of rails.
Without attempting this the Hall system has one
other important feature in common with the English
block, and a very important feature, that of
enabling station agents in case of sudden emergency
to control the train movement within half a mile or
more of their stations on either side. Within the
given distance they can stop trains either leaving or
approaching. The inability to do this has been
the cause of some of the most disastrous collisions
on record, and notably those at Revere and at
Thorpe.</p>

<p>The one essential thing, however, in every perfect
block system, whether automatic or worked by
operators, is that in case of accident or derangement
or doubt, the signal should rest at danger. This the
Hall system now fully provides for, and in case even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of the wilful displacement of a switch, an occurrence
by no means without precedent in railroad experience,
the danger signal could not but be displayed,
even though the electric connection had been tampered
with. Accidents due to wilfullness, however,
can hardly be provided for except by police precautions.
Train wrecking is not to be taken into
account as a danger incident to the ordinary operation
of a railroad. Carelessness or momentary inadvertence,
or, most dangerous of all, that recklessness&mdash;that
unnecessary assumption of risk somewhere
or at some time, which is almost inseparable
from a long immunity from disaster&mdash;these are the
great sources of peril most carefully to be guarded
against. The complicated and unceasing train
movement depends upon many thousand employés,
all of whom make mistakes or assume risks sometimes;&mdash;and
did they not do so they would be either
more or less than men. Being, however, neither
angels nor machines, but ordinary mortals whose
services are bought for money at the average market
rate of wages, it would certainly seem no small
point gained if an automatic machine could be
placed on guard over those whom it is the great
effort of railroad discipline to reduce to automatons.
Could this result be attained, the unintentional
throwing of a lever or the carelessness which leaves
it thrown, would simply block the track instead of
leaving it broken. An example of this, and at the
same time a most forcible illustration of the possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
cost of a small economy in the application of a safeguard,
was furnished in the case of the Wollaston
disaster. At the time of that disaster, the Old
Colony railroad had for several years been partially
equipped on the portion of its track near Boston,
upon which the accident occurred, with Hall's system.
It had worked smoothly and easily, was well
understood by the employés, and the company was
sufficiently satisfied with it to have even then made
arrangements for its extension. Unfortunately, with
a too careful eye to the expenditure involved, the
line had been but partially equipped; points where
little danger was apprehended had not been protected.
Among these was the "Foundry switch,"
so called, near Wollaston. Had this switch been
connected with the system and covered by a signal-target,
the mere act of throwing it would have automatically
blocked the track, and only when it was
re-set would the track have been opened. The
switch was not connected, the train hands were
recklessly careless, and so a trifling economy cost in
one unguarded moment some fifty persons life and
limb, and the corporation more than $300,000.</p>

<p>One objection to the automatic block is generally
based upon the delicacy and complicated
character of the machinery on which its action
necessarily depends; and this objection is especially
urged against those other portions of the Hall
system, covering draws and level crossings, which
have been particularly described. It is argued that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
it is always liable to get out of order from a great
multiplicity of causes, some of which are very difficult
to guard against, and that it is sure to get out
of order during any electric disturbance; but it is
during storms that accidents are most likely to
occur, and especially is this the case at highway
grade-crossings. It is comparatively easy to avoid
accidents so long as the skies are clear and the
elements quiet; but it is exactly when this is not
the case and when it becomes necessary to use
every precaution, that electricity as a safeguard fails
or runs mad, and, by participating in the general
confusion, proves itself worse than nothing. Then
it will be found that those in charge of trains and
tracks, who have been educated into a reliance
upon it under ordinary circumstances, will from
force of habit, if nothing else, go on relying upon
it, and disaster will surely follow.</p>

<p>This line of reasoning is plausible, but none the
less open to one serious objection; it is sustained
neither by statistics nor by practical experience.
Moreover it is not new, for, slightly varied in phraseology,
it has been persistently urged against the introduction
of every new railroad appliance, and, indeed,
was first and most persistently of all urged
against the introduction of railroads themselves.
Pretty and ingenious in theory, practically it is not
feasible!&mdash;for more than half a century this formula
has been heard. That the automatic electric
signal system is complicated, and in many of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
parts of most delicate construction, is undeniable.
So also is the locomotive. In point of fact the
whole railroad organization from beginning to end&mdash;from
machine-shop to train-movement&mdash;is at once
so vast and complicated, so delicate in that action
which goes on with such velocity and power, that it
is small cause for wonder that in the beginning all
plain, sensible, practical men scouted it as the fanciful
creation of visionaries. They were wholly justified
in so doing; and to-day any sane man would
of course pronounce the combined safety and rapidity
of ordinary railroad movement an utter impossibility,
did he not see it going on before his eyes.
So it is with each new appliance. It is ever suggested
that at last the final result has already
been reached. It is but a few years, as will presently
be seen, since the Westinghouse brake encountered
the old "pretty and ingenious" formula.
Going yet a step further, and taking the case of
electricity itself, the bold conception of operating
an entire line of single track road wholly as respects
one half of its train movement by telegraph, and
without the use of any time table at all, would once
have been condemned as mad. Yet to-day half
of the vast freight movement of this continent is
carried on in absolute reliance on the telegraph.
Nevertheless it is still not uncommon to hear
among the class of men who rise to the height of
their capacity in themselves being automaton superintendents
that they do not believe in deviating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
from their time tables and printed rules; that,
acting under them, the men know or ought to
know exactly what to do, and any interference
by a train despatcher only relieves them of responsibility,
and is more likely to lead to accidents
than if they were left alone to grope their own
way out.</p>

<p>Another and very similar argument frequently
urged against the electric, in common with all other
block systems by the large class who prefer to exercise
their ingenuity in finding objections rather
than in overcoming difficulties, is that they breed
dependence and carelessness in employés;&mdash;that
engine-drivers accustomed to rely on the signals,
rely on them implicitly, and get into habits of recklessness
which lead inevitably to accidents, for which
they then contend the signals, and not they themselves,
are responsible. This argument is, indeed,
hardly less familiar than the "pretty and ingenious"
formula just referred to. It has, however, been met
and disposed of by Captain Tyler in his annual reports
to the Board of Trade in a way which can
hardly be improved upon:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is a favorite argument with those who oppose the
introduction of some of these improvements, or who
make excuses for the want of them, that their servants
are apt to become more careless from the use of them, in
consequence of the extra security which they are believed
to afford; and it is desirable to consider seriously
how much of truth there is in this assertion. * * *
Allowing to the utmost for these tendencies to confide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
too much in additional means of safety, the risk is
proved by experience to be very much greater without
them than with them; and, in fact, the negligence and
mistakes of servants are found to occur most frequently,
and generally with the most serious results, not when the
men are over-confident in their appliances or apparatus,
but when, in the absence of them, they are habituated
to risk in the conduct of the traffic. In the daily practice
of railway working station-masters, porters, signalmen,
engine-drivers or guards are frequently placed in
difficulties which they have to surmount as best they can.
The more they are accustomed to incur risk in order to
perform their duties, the less they think of it, and the
more difficult it is to enforce discipline and obedience
to regulations. The personal risk which is encountered
by certain classes of railway servants is coming to be
more precisely ascertained. It is very considerable; and
it is difficult to prevent men who are in constant danger
themselves from doing things which may be a source of
danger to others, or to compel them to obey regulations
for which they do not see altogether the necessity, and
which impede them in their work. This difficulty increases
with the want of necessary means and appliances;
and is diminished when, with proper means and appliances,
stricter discipline becomes possible, safer modes of
working become habitual, and a higher margin of safety
is constantly preserved.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In Great Britain the ingenious theory that superior
appliances or greater personal comfort in some
indefinable way lead to carelessness in employés
was carried to such an extent that only within the
last few years has any protection against wind, rain
and sunshine been furnished on locomotives for the
engine-drivers and stokers. The old stage-coach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
driver faced the elements, and why should not his
successor on the locomotive do the same?&mdash;If made
too comfortable, he would become careless and go
to sleep!&mdash;This was the line of argument advanced,
and the tortures to which the wretched men were
subjected in consequence of it led to their fortifying
nature by drink. They had to be regularly inspected
and examined before mounting the foot-board,
to see that they were sober. It took years
in Great Britain for intelligent railroad managers to
learn that the more protected and comfortable a man
is the better he will attend to his duty. And even
when the old argument, refuted by long experience,
was at last abandoned as respected the locomotive
cab, it, with perfect freshness and confidence in its
own novelty and force, promptly showed its brutal
visage in opposition to the next new safeguard.</p>

<p>For the reasons which Captain Tyler has so
forcibly put in the extracts which have just
been quoted, the argument against the block system
from the increased carelessness of employés,
supposed to be induced by it, is entitled to no
weight. Neither is the argument from the delicacy
and complication of the automatic, electric
signal system entitled to any more, when urged
against that. Not only has it been too often
refuted under similar conditions by practical results,
but in this case it is based on certain assumptions
of fact which are wholly opposed to experience.
The record does not show that there is any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
peculiar liability to railroad accidents during periods
of storm; perhaps because those in charge
of train movements or persons crossing tracks are
under such circumstances more especially on the
look out for danger. On the contrary the full average
of accidents of the worst description appear
to have occurred under the most ordinary conditions
of weather, and usually in the most unanticipated
way. This is peculiarly true of accidents
at highway grade crossings. These commonly occur
when the conditions are such as to cause the
highway travelers to suppose that, if any danger
existed, they could not but be aware of it. In the
next place, the question in regard to automatic
electric signals is exactly what it was in regard to
the Westinghouse brake, with its air-pump, its valves
and connecting tubes;&mdash;it is the purely practical
question,&mdash;Does the thing work?&mdash;The burden of
proof is properly on the inventor. The presumption
is all against him. In the case of the electric
signals they have for years been in limited
but constant use, and while thus in use they have
been undergoing steady improvement. Though
now brought to a considerable degree of comparative
perfection they are, of course, still in their
earlier stage of development. In use, however,
they have not been found open to the practical
objections urged against them. At first much too
complicated and expensive, requiring more machinery
than could by any reasonable exertions be kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
in order and more care than they were worth, they
have now been simplified until a single battery
properly located can do all the necessary work for a
road of indefinite length. As a system they are
effective and do not lead to accidents; nor are they
any more subject than telegraph wires to derangement
from atmospheric causes. When any disturbance
does take place, until it can be overcome it
amounts simply to a general signal for operating the
road with extreme caution. But with railroads, as
everywhere else in life, it is the normal condition of
affairs for which provision must be made, while the
dangers incident to exceptional circumstances must
be met by exceptional precautions. As long as
things are in their normal state, that is, probably,
during nineteen days out of twenty, the electric signals
have now through several years of constant
trial proved themselves a reliable safeguard. It can
hardly admit of doubt that in the near future
they will be both further perfected and generally
adopted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>INTERLOCKING.</h3>


<p>In their management of switches, especially at
points of railroad convergence where a heavy traffic
is concentrated and the passage of trains or movement
of cars and locomotives is unceasing, the English
are immeasurably in advance of the Americans;
and, indeed, of all other people. In fact, in this respect
the American managers have shown themselves
slow to learn, and have evinced an indisposition
to adopt labor-saving appliances which, considering
their usual quickness of discernment in that
regard, is at first sight inexplicable. Having always
been accustomed to the old and simple methods,
just so long as they can through those methods
handle their traffic with a bearable degree of inconvenience
and expense, they will continue to do so.
That their present method is most extravagant, just
as extravagant as it would be to rent two houses or
to run two steam engines where one, if properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
used, could be made to suffice, admits of demonstration;&mdash;but
the waste is not on the surface, and
the necessity for economy is not imperative. The
difference of conditions and the difference in results
may be made very obvious by a comparison. Take,
for instance, London and Boston&mdash;the Cannon street
station in the one and the Beach street station in
the other. The concentration of traffic at London
is so great that it becomes necessary to utilize every
foot of ground devoted to railroad purposes to the
utmost possible extent. Not only must it be packed
with tracks, but those tracks must never be idle.
The incessant train movement at Cannon street has
already been referred to as probably the most extraordinary
and confusing spectacle in the whole wide
circle of railroad wonders. The result is that in
some way, at this one station and under this single
roof, more trains must daily be made to enter and
leave than enter and leave, not only the Beach
street station, but all the eight railroad stations in
Boston combined.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>
<p>During eighteen successive hours trains have
been made to enter and leave this station at the
rate of more than one in each minute. It contains
four platforms and seven tracks, the longest of
which is 720 feet. As compared with the largest station
in Boston (the Boston &amp; Providence), it has
the same number of platforms and an aggregate of
1,500 (three-fifths) more feet of track under cover; it
daily accommodates about nine times as many trains
and four times as many passengers. Of it Barry, in
his treatise on Railway Appliances (p. 197), says:
"The platform area at this station is probably minimised
but, the station accommodates efficiently a
very large mixed traffic of long and short journey
trains, amounting at times to as many as 400 trains
in and 400 trains out in a working day.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>"</p>

<p>The American system is, therefore, one of great
waste; for, being conducted in the way it is&mdash;that is
with stations and tracks utilized to but a fractional
part of their utmost capacity&mdash;it requires a large
number of stations and tracks and the services of
many employés. Indeed it is safe to say that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
judged by the London standard, not more than two
of the eight stations in Boston are at this time utilized
to above a quarter part of their full working
capacity; and the same is probably true of all other
American cities. Both employés and the travelling
public are accustomed to a slow movement and abundance
of room; land is comparatively cheap, and the
pressure of concentration has only just begun to
make itself felt. Accordingly any person, who cares
to pass an hour during the busy time of day in front
of an American city station, cannot but be struck,
while watching the constant movement, with the
primitive way in which it is conducted. Here are
a multiplicity of tracks all connected with each
other, and cars and locomotives are being passed
from one to another from morning to night. A
constant shifting of switches is going on, and the
little shunting engines never stand still. The
switches, however, as a rule, are unprovided with
signals, except of the crudest description; they
have no connection with each other, and during
thirty years no change has been made in the
method in which they are worked. When one of
them has to be shifted, a man goes to it and shifts
it. To facilitate the process, the monitor shunting
engines are provided with a foot-board in front and
behind, just above the track, upon which the yard
hands jump, and are carried about from switch to
switch, thus saving the time they would occupy if
they had to walk. A simpler arrangement could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
not be imagined; anyone could devise it. The only
wonder is that even a considerable traffic can be
conducted safely in reliance upon it.</p>

<p>Turning from Beach to Cannon street, it is apparent
that the train movement which has there to
be accommodated would fall into inextricable confusion
if it was attempted to manage it in the way
which has been described. The number of trains is
so great and the movement so rapid and intricate,
that not even a regiment of employés stationed here
and there at the signals and switches could keep
things in motion. From time to time they would
block, and then the whole vast machine would be
brought to a standstill until order could be re-established.
The difficulty is overcome in a very simple
way, by means of an equally simple apparatus. The
control over the numerous switches and corresponding
signals, instead of being divided up among
many men stationed at many points, is concentrated
in the hands of two men occupying a single gallery,
which is elevated across the tracks in front of the
station and commanding the approaches to it, much
as the pilot-house of an American steamer commands
a view of the course before it. From this
gallery, by means of what is known as the interlocking
system, every switch and signal in the yard below
is moved; and to such a point of perfection has
the apparatus been carried, that any disaster from
the misplacement of a switch or the display of a
wrong signal is rendered impossible. Of this Cannon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
street apparatus Barry says, "there are here
nearly seventy point and signal levers concentrated
in one signal house; the number of combinations
which would be possible if all the signal and point
levers were not interlocked can be expressed only
by millions. Of these only 808 combinations are
safe, and by the interlocking apparatus these 808
combinations are rendered possible, and all the
others impossible."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>It is not proposed to enter at any length into the
mechanical details of this appliance, which, however,
must be considered as one of the three or four great
inventions which have marked epochs in the history
of railroad traffic.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> As, however, it is but little
known in America, and will inevitably within the
next few years find here the widest field for its increased
use, a slight sketch of its gradual development
and of its leading mechanical features may not
be out of place. Prior to the year 1846 the switches
and signals on the English roads were worked in the
same way that they are now commonly worked in
this country. As a train drew near to a junction,
for instance, the switchman stationed there made
the proper track connection and then displayed the
signal which indicated what tracks were opened and
what closed, and which line had the right of way;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and the engine-drivers acted accordingly. As the
number of trains increased and the movement at the
junctions became more complicated, the danger of
the wrong switches being thrown or the wrong signals
displayed, increased also. Mistakes from time
to time would happen, even when only the most
careful and experienced men were employed; and
mistakes in these matters led to serious consequences.
It, therefore, became the practice, instead of having
the switch or signal lever at the point where the
switch or signal itself was, as is still almost universally
the case in this country, to connect them by
rods or wires with their levers, which were concentrated
at some convenient point for working, and
placed under the control of one man instead of several.
So far as it went this change was an improvement,
but no provision yet existed against the danger
of mistake in throwing switches and displaying
signals. The blunder of first making one combination
of tracks and then showing the signal for another
was less liable to happen after the concentration
of the levers under one hand than before, but
it still might happen at any time, and certainly
would happen at some time. If all danger of accident
from human fallibility was ever to be eliminated
a far more complicated mechanical apparatus
must be devised. In response to this need
the system of interlocking was gradually developed,
though not until about the year 1856 was it brought
to any considerable degree of perfection. The whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
object of this system is to render it impossible for a
switchman, whether because he is weary or agitated
or actually malicious or only inexperienced, to give
contrary signals, or to break his line in one way and
to give the signal for its being broken in another
way. To bring this about the levers are concentrated
in a cabin or gallery, and placed side by side in a
frame, their lower ends connecting with the switch-points
and signals by means of rods and wires. Beneath
this frame are one or more long bars, extending
its entire length under it and parallel with it.
These are called locking bars; for, being moved to
the right or left by the action of the levers they
hold these levers in certain designated positions, nor
do they permit them to occupy any other. In this
way what is termed the interlocking is effected.
The apparatus, though complicated, is simplicity itself
compared with a clock or a locomotive. The
complication, also, such as it is, arises from the fact
that each situation is a problem by itself, and as
such has to be studied out and provided for separately.
This, however, is a difficulty affecting the
manufacturer rather than the operator. To the latter
the apparatus presents no difficulty which a
fairly intelligent mechanic cannot easily master;
while for the former the highly complicated nature
of the problem may, perhaps, best be inferred
from the example given by Mr. Barry, the simplest
that can offer, that of an ordinary junction
where a double-track branch-road connects with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
its double-track main line. There would in this
case be of necessity two switch levers and four
signal levers, which would admit of sixty-four
possible combinations. "The signal might be arranged
in any of sixteen ways, and the points
might occupy any of four positions, irrespective of
the position of the signals. Of the sixty-four combinations
thus possible only thirteen are safe, and
the rest are such as might lure an engine-driver
into danger."</p>

<p>Originally the locking bar was worked through
the direct action of certain locks, as they were
called, between which the levers when moved played
to and fro. These locks were mere bars or plates
of iron, some with inclined sides, and others with
sides indented or notched. At one end they were
secured on a pivot to a fixed bar opposite to and
parallel with the movable locking bar, while their
other ends were made fast to the locking bar; whence
it necessarily followed that, as certain of the levers
were pushed to and fro between them, the action
of these levers on the inclined sides of the locks
could by a skilful combination be made to throw
other levers into the notches and indentations of
other locks, thus securing them in certain positions,
and making it impossible for them to be in any
other positions.</p>

<p>The apparatus which has been described, though
a great improvement on anything which had preceded
it, was still but a clumsy affair, and naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the friction of the levers on the locks was so great
that they soon became worn, and when worn they
could not be relied upon to move the switch-points
with the necessary accuracy. The new appliance
of safety had, therefore, as is often the case, introduced
a new and very considerable danger of its
own. The signals and switches, it was true, could
no longer disagree, but the points themselves were
sometimes not properly set, or, owing to the great
exertion required to work it, the interlocking gear
was strained. This difficulty resulted in the next
and last improvement, which was a genuine triumph
of mechanical ingenuity. To insure the proper
length of stroke being made in moving the lever&mdash;that
is to make it certain in each case that the
switch points were brought into exactly the proper
position&mdash;two notches were provided in the slot,
or quadrant, as it is called, in which the lever
moved, and, when it was thrown squarely home,
and not until then, a spring catch caught in one or
other of these notches. This spring was worked
by a clasp at the handle of the lever, and the whole
was called the spring catch-rod. By a singularly ingenious
contrivance, the process of interlocking was
transferred from the action of the levers and the
keys to these spring catch-rods, which were made to
work upon each other, and thus to become the medium
through which the whole process is effected.
The result of this improvement was that, as the
switchman cannot move any lever until the spring-catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
rod is fastened, except for a particular movement,
he cannot, do what he will, even begin any
other movement than that one, as the levers cannot
be started. On the other hand, it may be said that,
by means of this improvement, the mere "intention
of the signal-man to move any lever, expressed by
his grasping the lever and so raising the spring
catch-rod, independently of his putting his intention
in force, actuates all the necessary locking.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>
<p>In spite of any theoretical or fanciful objections
which may be urged against it, this appliance will
be found an indispensable adjunct to any really
heavy junction or terminal train movement. For
the elevated railroads of New York, for instance, its
early adoption proved a necessity. As for questions
of temperature, climate, etc., as affecting the
long connecting rods and wires which are an essential
part of the system, objections based upon them
are purely imaginary. Difficulties from this source
were long since met and overcome by very simple
compensating arrangements, and in practice occasion
no inconvenience. That rods may break, and
that wires are at all times liable to get out of gear,
every one knows; and yet this fact is urged as a
novel objection to each new mechanical improvement.
That a broken or disordered apparatus will
always occasion a serious disturbance to any heavy
train movement, may also be admitted. The fact
none the less remains that in practice, and daily
subjected through long periods of time to incomparably
the heaviest train movement known to railroad
experience, the rods of the interlocking apparatus
do not break, nor do its wires get out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
gear; while by means of it, and of it alone, this
train movement goes unceasingly on never knowing
any serious disturbance.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>It is not, however, alone in connection with terminal
stations and junctions that the interlocking
apparatus is of value. It is also the scientific substitute
for the law or regulation compelling trains to
stop as a measure of precaution when they approach
grade-crossings or draw-bridges. It is difficult indeed
to pass from the consideration of this fine result
of science and to speak with patience of the
existing American substitute for it. If the former
is a feature in the block system, the latter is a signal
example of the block-head system. As a device
to avoid danger it is a standing disgrace to American
ingenuity; and, fortunately, as stopping is compatible
only with a very light traffic, so soon as
the passage of trains becomes incessant a substitute
for it has got to be devised. In this country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
as in England, that substitute will be found in
the interlocking apparatus. By means of it the
draw-bridge, for instance, can be so connected with
the danger signals&mdash;which may, if desired, be gates
closing across the railroad tracks&mdash;that the one cannot
be opened except by closing the other. This
is the method adopted in Great Britain not only at
draws in bridges, but frequently also in the case
of gates at level road crossings. It has already
been noticed that in Great Britain accidents at
draws in bridges seem to be unknown. Certainly
not one has been reported during the last nine
years. The security afforded in this case by interlocking
would, indeed, seem to be absolute; as, if
the apparatus is out of order, either the gates or the
bridge would be closed, and could not be opened
until it was repaired. So also as respects the grade-crossing
of one railroad by another. Bringing all
trains to a complete stop when approaching these
crossings is a precaution quite generally observed in
America, either as a matter of statute law or running
regulation; and yet during the six years
1873-8 no less than 104 collisions were reported at
these crossings. In Great Britain during the nine
years 1870-8 but nine cases of accidents of this
description were reported, and in both the years
1877 and 1878 under the head of "Accidents or
Collisions on Level Crossings of Railways," the
chief inspector of the Board of Trade tersely stated
that,&mdash;"No accident was inquired into under this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
head.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>" The interlocking system there affords the
most perfect protection which can be devised
against a most dangerous practice in railroad construction
to which Americans are almost recklessly
addicted. It is, also, matter of daily experience
that the interlocking system does afford a perfect
practical safeguard in this case. Every junction
of a branch with a double track road involves
a grade-crossing, and a grade-crossing of
the most dangerous character. On the Metropolitan
Elevated railroad of New York, at 53d
street, there is one of these junctions, where, all
day long, trains are crossing at grade at the rate
of some twenty miles an hour. These trains
never stop, except when signalled so to do. The
interlocking apparatus, however, makes it impossible
that one track should be open except when the
other is closed. An accident, therefore, can happen
only through the wilful carelessness of the engineer
in charge of a train;&mdash;and in the face of wilful
carelessness laws are of no more avail than signals.
If a man in control of a locomotive wishes
to bring on a collision he can always do it. Unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
he wishes to, however, the interlocking apparatus
not only can prevent him from so doing, but as
a matter of fact always does. The same rule
which holds good at junctions would hold good at
level crossings. There is no essential difference between
the two. By means of the interlocking apparatus
the crossing can be so blocked at any desired
distance from it in such a way that when one track
is open the other must be closed;&mdash;unless, indeed,
the apparatus is out of order, and then both would
be closed. The precaution in this case, also, is absolute.
Unlike the rule as to stopping, it does not
depend on the caution or judgment of individuals;&mdash;there
are the signals and the obstructions, and if
they are not displayed on one road they are on the
other. So superior is this apparatus in every respect&mdash;as
regards safety as well as convenience&mdash;to the
precaution of coming to a stop, that, as an inducement
to introduce an almost perfect scientific appliance,
it would be very desirable that states like
Massachusetts and Connecticut compelling the stop,
should except from the operation of the law all draw-bridges
or grade-crossings at which suitable interlocking
apparatus is provided. Surely it is not unreasonable
that in this case science should have a
chance to assert itself.</p>

<p>In any event, however, the general introduction
of the interlocking apparatus into the American
railroad system may be regarded as a mere question
of the value of land and concentration of traffic. So
long as every road terminating in our larger cities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
indulges, at whatever unnecessary cost to its stockholders,
in independent station buildings far removed
from business centres, the train movement can
most economically be conducted as it now is. The
expense of the interlocking apparatus is avoided by
the very simple process of incurring the many fold
heavier expense of several station buildings and vast
disconnected station grounds. If, however, in the
city of Boston, for instance, the time should come
when the financial and engineering audacity of the
great English companies shall be imitated,&mdash;when
some leading railroad company shall fix its central
passenger station on Tremont street opposite the
head of Court street, just as in London the South
Eastern established itself on Cannon street, and then
this company carrying its road from Pemberton
Square by a tunnel under Beacon Hill and the State-house
should at the crossing of the Charles radiate
out so as to afford all other roads an access for their
trains to the same terminal point, thus concentrating
there the whole daily movement of that busy population
which makes of Boston its daily counting-room
and market-place,&mdash;then, when this is attempted, the
time will have come for utilizing to its utmost
capacity every available inch of space to render possible
the incessant passage of trains. Then also will
it at last be realized that it is far cheaper to use a
costly and intricate apparatus which enables two
companies to be run into one convenient station,
than it is to build a separate station, even at an inconvenient
point, to accommodate each company.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>THE WESTINGHOUSE BRAKE.</h3>


<p>In March, 1825, there appeared in the pages of
the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> an article in which the writer
discussed that railway system, the first vague anticipation
of which was then just beginning to make
the world restless. He did this, too, in a very intelligent
and progressive spirit, but unfortunately
secured for his article a permanence of interest he
little expected by the use of one striking illustration.
He was peculiarly anxious to draw a distinct
line of demarcation between his own very rational
anticipations and the visionary dreams of those enthusiasts
who were boring the world to death over
the impossibilities which they claimed that the new
invention was to work. Among these he referred to
the proposition that passengers would be "whirled
at the rate of eighteen or twenty miles an hour by
means of a high pressure engine," and then contemptuously
added,&mdash;"We should as soon expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the people of Woolwich to suffer themselves to be
fired off upon one of Congreve's <i>ricochet</i> rockets, as
trust themselves to the mercy of such a machine,
going at such a rate; their property perhaps they
may trust."</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, the criticism was a perfectly
reasonable one. The danger involved in
going at such a rate of speed and the impossibility
of stopping in time to avoid a sudden danger,
would naturally suggest themselves to any one as
insuperable objections to the new system for any
practical use. Some means of preserving a sudden
and powerful control over a movement of such unheard
of rapidity would almost as a matter of course
be looked upon as a condition precedent. Yet it
is a most noticeable fact in the history of railroad
development that the improvement in appliances
for controlling speed by no means kept pace with
the increased rate of speed attained. Indeed, so
far as the possibility of rapid motion is concerned,
there is no reason to suppose that the <i>Rocket</i>
could not have held its own very respectably by
the side of a passenger locomotive of the present
day. It will be remembered that on the occasion of
the Manchester &amp; Liverpool opening, Mr. Huskisson
after receiving his fatal injury was carried seventeen
miles in twenty-five minutes. Since then the details
of locomotive construction have been simplified and
improved upon, but no great change has been or
probably will be effected in the matter of velocity;&mdash;as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
respects that the maximum was practically reached
at once. Yet down to the year 1870 the brake system
remained very much what it was in 1830. Improvements
in detail were effected, but the essential
principles were the same. In case of any sudden
emergency, the men in charge of the locomotive had
no direct control over the vehicles in the train; they
communicated with them by the whistle, and when
the signal was heard the brakes were applied as soon
as might be. When a train is moving at the rate
of forty miles an hour, by no means a great speed
for it while in full motion, it passes over fifty-eight
feet each second;&mdash;at sixty miles an hour it passes
over eighty-eight feet. Under these circumstances,
supposing an engine driver to become suddenly aware
of an obstruction on the track, as was the case at
Revere, or of something wrong in the train behind
him, as at Shipton, he had first himself to signal
danger, and to this signal the brakemen throughout
the train had to respond. Each operation required
time, and every second of time represented many
feet of space. It was small matter for surprise,
therefore, that when in 1875 they experimented
scientifically in England, it was ascertained that a
train of a locomotive and thirteen cars moving at a
speed of forty-five miles an hour could not be brought
to a stand in less than one minute, or before it had
traversed a distance of half a mile. The same result
it will be remembered was arrived at by practical
experience in America, where both at Angola<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and at Port Jervis,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> it was found impossible to stop
the trains in less than half-a-mile, though in each
case two derailed cars were dragging and plunging
along at the end of them.</p>

<p>The need of a continuous train-brake, operated
from the locomotive and under the immediate control
of the engine-driver, had been emphasized through
years by the almost regular recurrence of accidents of
the most appalling character. In answer to this need
almost innumerable appliances had been patented and
experimented with both in Europe and in America.
Prior to 1869, however, these had been almost exclusively
what are known as emergency brakes;&mdash;that
is, although the trains were equipped with them
and they were operated from the locomotives, they
were not relied upon for ordinary use, but were held
in reserve, as it were, against special exigencies. The
Hudson River railroad train at the Hamburg accident
was thus equipped. Practically, appliances
which in the operation of railroads are reserved for
emergencies are usually found of little value when
the emergency occurs. Accordingly no continuous
brake had, prior to the development of Westinghouse's
invention, worked its way into general use.
Patent brakes had become a proverb as well as a
terror among railroad mechanics, and they had ceased
to believe that any really desirable thing of the sort
would ever be perfected. Westinghouse, therefore,
had a most unbelieving audience to encounter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
his invention had to fight hard for all the favor it
won; nor did his experience with master mechanics
differ, probably, much from Miller's. His first
patents were taken out in 1869, and he early secured
the powerful aid of the Pennsylvania road
for his invention. The Pullman Car Company,
also, always anxious to avail themselves of every
appliance of safety as well as of comfort, speedily
saw the merits of the new brake and adopted it;
but, as they merely furnished cars and had nothing
to do with the locomotives that pulled them, their
support was not so effective as that of the great
railroad company. Naturally enough, also, great
hesitation was felt in adopting so complicated an
appliance. It added yet another whole apparatus
to a thing which was already overburdened with
machinery. There was, also, something in the delicacy
and precision of the parts of this new contrivance,&mdash;in
its air-pump and reservoirs and long connecting
tubes with their numerous valves,&mdash;which
was peculiarly distasteful to the average practical railroad
mechanic. It was true that the idea of transmitting
power by means of compressed air was
by no means new,&mdash;that thousands of drills were
being daily driven by it wherever tunnelling was
going on or miners were at work,&mdash;yet the application
of this familiar power to the wheels of
a railroad train seemed no less novel than it was
bold. It was, in the first place, evident that the
new apparatus would not stand the banging and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
hammering to which the old-fashioned hand-brake
might safely be subjected; not indeed without deranging
that simple appliance, but without incurring
any very heavy bill for repairs in so doing.
Accordingly the new brake was at first carelessly
examined and patronizingly pushed aside as a
pretty toy,&mdash;nice in theory no doubt, but wholly
unfitted for rough, every-day use. As it was
tersely expressed during a discussion before the
Society of Arts in London, as recently as May,
1877,&mdash;"It was no use bringing out a brake which
could not be managed by ordinary officials,&mdash;which
was so wonderfully clever that those who had to use
it could not understand it." A line of argument by
the way, which, as has been already pointed out,
may with far greater force be applied to the locomotive
itself; and, indeed, unquestionably was so
applied about half a century ago by men of the same
calibre who apply it now, to the intense weariness
and discouragement no doubt of the late George
Stephenson. Whether sound or otherwise, however,
few more effective arguments against an appliance
can be advanced; and against the Westinghouse
brake it was advanced so effectively, that even as
late as 1871, although largely in use on western
roads, it had found its way into Massachusetts only
as an ingenious device of doubtful merit. It was in
August, 1871, that the Revere disaster occurred,
and the Revere disaster, as has been seen, would
unquestionably have been averted had the colliding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
train been provided with proper brake power. This
at last called serious attention there to the new
appliance. Even then, however, the mere suggestion
of something better being in existence than
the venerable hand-brakes in familiar use did not
pass without a vigorous protest; and at the meeting
of railroad officials, which has already been
referred to as having been called by the state commissioners
after the accident, one prominent gentleman,
when asked if the road under his charge was
equipped with the most approved brake, indignantly
replied that it was,&mdash;that it was equipped
with the good, old-fashioned hand-brake;&mdash;and he
then proceeded to vehemently stake his professional
reputation on the absolute superiority of that
ancient but somewhat crude appliance over anything
else of the sort in existence. Nevertheless, on
this occasion also, the great dynamic force which
is ever latent in first-class railroad accidents again
asserted itself. Even the most opinionated of professional
railroad men, emphatically as he might
in public deny it, quietly yielded as soon as might
be. In a surprisingly short time after the exhibition
of ignorance which has been referred to, the
railroads in Massachusetts, as it has already been
shown, were all equipped with train-brakes.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In its present improved shape it is safe to say
that in all those requisites which the highest authorities
known on the subject have laid down as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
essential to a model train brake, the Westinghouse
stands easily first among the many inventions of the
kind. It is now a much more perfect appliance
than it was in 1871, for it was then simply atmospheric
and continuous in its action, whereas it has
since been made automatic and self-regulating. So
far as its fundamental principle is concerned, that
is too generally understood to call for explanation.
By means of an air-pump, attached to the
boiler of the locomotive and controlled by the engine-driver,
an atmospheric force is brought to bear,
through tubes running under the cars, upon the
break blocks, pressing them against the wheels. The
hand of the engine-driver is in fact on every wheel
in the train. This application of power, though unquestionably
ingenious and, like all good things,
most simple and obvious when once pointed out,
was originally open to one great objection, which
was persistently and with great force urged against
it. The parts of the apparatus were all delicate, and
some injury or derangement of them was always
possible, and sometimes inevitable. The chief advantage
claimed for the brake was, however, that
complete dependence could be placed upon it in
the regular movement of trains. It was obvious,
therefore, that if such dependence was placed upon
it and any derangement did occur, the first intimation
those in charge of the train would have that
something was wrong might well come in the shape
of a failure of the brake to act, and a subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
disaster. Both in Massachusetts and in Connecticut,
at the crossing of one railroad by another at
the same level in the former state and in the approach
to draws in bridges in the latter, a number
of cases of this failure of the original Westinghouse
non-automatic brake to act did in point of fact
occur. Fortunately they, none of them, resulted
in disaster. This, however, was mere good luck,
as was illustrated in the case of the accident of
November 11, 1876, at the Communipaw Ferry
on the New Jersey Central. The train was there
equipped with the ordinary train brake. It reached
Jersey City on time shortly after 4 <small>P.M.</small>, but, instead
of slacking up, it ran directly through the station
and freight offices, carrying away the walls and supports,
and the locomotive then plunged into the
river beyond. The baggage and smoking car followed
but fortunately lodged on the locomotive,
thus blocking the remainder of the train. Fortunately
no one was killed, and no passengers were
seriously injured.</p>

<p>Again, on the Metropolitan Elevated railroad in
New York city, on the evening of June 23, 1879,
one of the trains was delayed for a few moments
at the Franklin street station. Meanwhile the next
train came along, and, though the engine-driver of
this following train saw the danger signals and endeavored
to stop in time, he found his brake out of
order, and a collision ensued resulting in the injury
of one employé and the severe shattering of a passenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
coach and locomotive. It was only a piece
of good fortune that the first of these accidents did
not result in a repetition of the Norwalk disaster
and the second in that of Revere.</p>

<p>It so chanced that it was the Smith vacuum
brake which failed to work at Communipaw, and
the Eames vacuum which failed to work at Franklin
street. This, however, was wholly immaterial. It
might just as well have been the original Westinghouse.
The difficulty lay, not in the maker's
name, but in the imperfect action of the brake;
and such significant intimations are not to be disregarded.
The chances are naturally large that
the failure of the continuous brake to act will
not at once occur under just those circumstances
which will entail a serious disaster and heavy loss
of life; that, however, if such intimations as these
are disregarded, it will sooner or later so occur does
not admit of doubt.</p>

<p>But the possibility that upon some given occasion
it might fail to work was not the only defect in the
original Westinghouse; it might well be in perfect
order and in full action even, and then suddenly, as
the result of derailment or separation of parts, the
apparatus might be broken, and at once the shoes
would drop from the wheels, and the vehicles of the
disabled train would either press forward, or, on an
incline, stop and run backwards until their unchecked
momentum was exhausted. This appears
to have been the case at Wollaston, and contributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
some of its most disastrous features to that
accident.</p>

<p>To obviate these defects Westinghouse in 1872
invented what he termed a triple valve attachment,
by means of which, if the thing can be so expressed,
his brake was made to always stand at danger.
That is, in case of any derangement of its parts, it
was automatically applied and the train stopped.
The action of the brake was thus made to give
notice of anything wrong anywhere in the train.
A noticeable case of this occurred on the Midland
railway in England, when on the November 22,
1876, as the Scotch express was approaching the
Heeley station, at a speed of some sixty miles an
hour, the hind-guard felt the automatic brake suddenly
self-applied. The forward truck of a Pullman
car in the middle of the train had left the rails; the
front part of the train broke the couplings and
went on, while the rear carriages, acted upon by
the automatic brakes, came to a stand immediately
behind the Pullman, which finally rested on its side
across the opposite track. There was no loss of
life. On the other hand, as the Scotch express on
the North Eastern road was approaching Morpeth,
on March 25, 1877, at a speed of some twenty-five
miles an hour, the locomotive for some reason left
the track. The train was not equipped with an
automatic brake, and the carriages in it accordingly
pressed forward upon each other until three of
them were so utterly destroyed as to be indistinguishable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Five passengers lost their lives; the
remains of one of whom, together with the wheels
of a carriage, were afterwards taken out from the
tank of the tender, into which they had been driven
by the force of the shock.</p>

<p>The theoretical objection to the automatic brake
is obvious. In case of any derangement of its machinery
it applies itself, and, should these derangements
be of frequent occurrence, the consequent
stoppage of trains would prove a great annoyance,
if not a source of serious danger. This objection
is not sustained by practical experience. The
triple valve, so called, is the only complicated portion
of the automatic brake, and this valve is well
protected and not liable to get out of order.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
Should it become deranged it will stop the working
of the brake on that car alone to which it belongs;
and it will become deranged so as to set the
brake only from causes which would render the non-automatic
brake inoperative. When anything of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
sort occurs, it stops the train until the defect is
remedied. The returns made to the English Board
of Trade enable us to know just how frequently in
actual and regular service these stoppages occur,
and what they amount to. Take, for instance, the
North Eastern and the Caledonian railways. Both
use the automatic brake. During the last six
months of 1878 the first ran 138,000 train miles with
it, in the course of which there were eight delays
or stoppages of some three to five minutes each
occasioned by the action of the triple-valve; being
in round numbers one occasion of delay in 17,000
miles of train movement. On the Caledonian railway,
during the same period, four brake failures,
due to the action of the triple-valve, were reported
in runs aggregating over 62,000 miles, being about
one failure to 15,000 miles. These failures moreover
occasioned delays of only a few minutes each,
and, where the cause of the difficulty was not
so immediately apparent that it could at once
be remedied, the brake-tubes of the vehicle on
which the difficulty occurred were disconnected,
and the trains went on.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> One of these stoppages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
however, resulted in a serious accident. As
a train on the Caledonian road was approaching
the Wemyss Bay junction on December 14th,
in a dense fog, the engine driver, seeing the signals
at danger, undertook to apply his brake
slightly, when it went full on, stopping the train
between the distant and home signals, as they
are called in the English block system. After the
danger signal was lowered, but before the brake
could be released, the signal-man allowed a following
train to enter upon the same block section, and
a collision followed in which some thirteen passengers
were slightly injured. This accident, however,
as the inspecting officer of the Board of Trade
very properly found, was due not at all to the automatic
brake, but to "carelessness on the part of the
signal-man, who disregarded the rules for the working
of the block telegraph instruments," and to the
driver of the colliding train, who "disobeyed the
company's running regulations." It gives an American,
however, a realizing sense of one of the difficulties
under which those crowded British lines are
operated, to read that in this case the fog was "so
thick that the tail-lamp was not visible from an approaching
train for more than a few yards."</p>

<p>After the application of the triple valve had made
it automatic, there remained but one further improvement
necessary to render the Westinghouse a
well-nigh perfect brake. A superabundance of self-acting
power had been secured, but no provision was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
yet made for graduating the use of that power so
that it should be applied in the exact degree, neither
more nor less, which would soonest stop the train.
This for two reasons is mechanically a matter of no
little importance. As is well known a too severe
application of brakes, no matter of what kind they
are, causes the wheels to stand still and slide upon
the rails. This is not only very injurious to rolling
stock, the wheels of which are flattened at the points
which slide, but, as has long been practically well-known
to those whose business it is to run locomotives,
when once the wheels begin to slide the retarding
power of the brakes is seriously diminished. In
order, therefore, to secure the maximum of retarding
power, the pressure of the brake-blocks on the revolving
wheels should be very great when first applied,
and just sufficient not to slide them; and should
then be diminished, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pari passu</i> with the momentum
of the train, until it wholly stops. Familiar as
all this has long been to engine-drivers and practical
railroad mechanics, yet it has not been conceded in
the results of many scientific inquiries. In the report
of one of the Royal Commissions on Accidents,
for instance, it was asserted that the momentum
of a train was retarded more by the action
of sliding than of slowly revolving wheels;
and again, as recently as in May, 1877, in a
scientific discussion in London at one of the meetings
of the Society of Arts, a gentleman, with
the letters C. E. appended to his name, ventured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the surprising assertion that "no brake could do
more than skid the wheels of a train, and all
continuous brakes professed to do this, and he
believed did so about equally well." Now, what it
is here asserted no brake can do is exactly what the
perfect brake will be made to do,&mdash;and what Westinghouse's
latest improvement, it is claimed, enables
his brake to do. It much more than "skids the
wheels," by measuring out exactly that degree of
power necessary to hold the wheels just short of
the skidding point, and in this way always exerts
the maximum retarding force. This is brought
about by means of a contrivance which allows the
air to leak out of the brake cylinders so as to exactly
proportion the pressure of the blocks on the
wheels to the speed with which the latter are revolving.
In other, and more scientific, language
the force with which the brake-blocks are pressed
upon the wheels is made to adjust itself automatically
as the "coefficient of dynamic friction
augments with the reduction of train speed." It
hardly needs to be said that in this way the power
of the brake is enormously increased.</p>

<p>In America the superiority of the Westinghouse
over any other description of train-brake has long
been established through that large preponderance
of use which in such matters constitutes the final
and irreversible verdict.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> In Europe, however, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
especially in Great Britain, ever since the Shipton-on-Cherwell
accident in 1874, the battle of the
brakes, as it may not inappropriately be called, has
waxed hotter and hotter; and not only has this
battle been extremely interesting in a scientific way,
but it has been highly characteristic, and at times
enlivened by touches of human nature which were
exceedingly amusing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>THE BATTLE OF THE BRAKES.</h3>


<p>The English battle of the brakes may be said
to have fairly opened with the official report from
Captain Tyler on the Shipton accident, in reference
to which he expressed the opinion, which has
already been quoted in describing the accident,
that "if the train had been fitted with continuous
brakes throughout its whole length there is no
reason why it should not have been brought
to rest without any casuality." The Royal Commission
on railroad accidents then took the matter
up and called for a series of scientifically conducted
experiments. These took place under the
supervision of two engineers appointed by the
Commission, who were aided by a detail of officers
and men from the royal engineers. Eight brakes
competed, and a train, consisting of a locomotive
and thirteen cars, was specially prepared for each.
With these trains some seventy runs were made, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
their results recorded and tabulated; the experiments
were continued through six consecutive working
days. Of the brakes experimented with three
were American in their origin,&mdash;Westinghouse's automatic
and vacuum, and Smith's vacuum. The remainder
were English, and were steam, hydraulic,
and air brakes; among them also was one simple
emergency brake. The result of the trials was a
very decided victory for the Westinghouse automatic,
and upon its performances the Commission
based its conclusion that trains ought to be so
equipped that in cases of emergency they could be
brought to rest, when travelling on level ground at
50 miles an hour, within a distance of 275 yards;
with an allowance of distance in cases of speed
greater or less than 50 miles nearly proportioned
to its square. These allowances they tabulated as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>To appreciate the enormous advance in what may
be called stopping power which these experiments
revealed, it should be added that the first series of
experiments made at Newark were with trains
equipped only with the hand-brake. The average<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
speed in these experiments was 47 miles, and with
the train-brake, according to the foregoing tabulation,
the stop should have been made in about 250
yards; in reality it was made in a little less than
five times that distance, or 1120 yards; in other
words the experiments showed that the improved
appliances had more than quadrupled the control
over trains. It has already been noticed that in
the cases of the Angola and the Port Jervis disasters,
as well as in that at Shipton, the trains ran
some 2,700 feet before they could be stopped. Under
the English tabulations above given, in the results
of which certain recent improvements do not
enter, a train running into the 42d Street Station
in New York, at a speed of forty-five miles an hour
when under the entrance arches, would be stopped
before it reached the buffers at the end of the
covered tracks.</p>

<p>The Royal Commission experiments were followed
in May and June, 1877, by yet others set on
foot by the North Eastern Railway Company for the
purpose of making a competitive test of the Westinghouse
automatic and the Smith's vacuum brakes.
At this trial also the average stop at a speed of 50
miles an hour was effected in 15 seconds, and within
a distance of 650 feet. Other series of experiments
with similar results were, about the same time, conducted
under the auspices of the Belgian and German
governments, of which elaborate official reports
were made. The result was that at last, under date<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of August 30, 1877, the Board of Trade issued a
circular to the railway companies in which it called
attention to the fact that, notwithstanding all the
discussion which had taken place and the elaborate
official trials which the government had set on foot,
there had "apparently been no attempt on the part
of the various companies to take the first step of
agreeing upon what are the requirements which, in
their opinion, are essential to a good continuous
brake." In other words, the Board found that, instead
of becoming better, matters were rapidly becoming
worse. Each company was equipping its
rolling stock with that appliance in which its officers
happened to be interested as owners or inventors,
and when carriages thus equipped passed from the
tracks of one road onto those of another the result
was a return to the old hand-brake system in a condition
of impaired efficiency. The Board accordingly
now proceeded to narrow down the field of selection
by specifying the following as what it considered
the essentials of a good continuous brake:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>a.</i> "The brakes to be efficient in stopping trains, instantaneous
in their actions, and capable of being applied
without difficulty by engine-drivers or guards.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> "In case of accident, to be instantaneously self-acting.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> "The brakes to be put on and taken off (with facility)
on the engine and on every vehicle of a train.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> "The brakes to be regularly used in daily working.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> "The materials employed to be of a durable character,
so as to be easily maintained and kept in order."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>These requirements pointed about as directly as
they could to the Westinghouse, to the exclusion of
all competing brakes. Not more than one other complied
with them in all respects, and many made no
pretence of complying at all. Then followed what
may be termed the battle royal of the brakes, which
as yet shows no signs of drawing to a close. As the
avowed object of the Board of Trade was to introduce,
one brake, to the necessary exclusion of all
others, throughout the railroad system of Great
Britain, the magnitude of the prize was not easy
to over-estimate. The weight of scientific and
official authority was decidedly in favor of the Westinghouse
automatic, but among the railroad men
the Smith vacuum found the largest number of adherents.
It failed to meet three of the requirements
of the Board of Trade, in that it was neither automatic
nor instantaneous in its action, while the materials
employed in it were not of a durable character.
It was, on the other hand, a brake of unquestioned
excellence, while it commended itself
to the judgment of the average railroad official by
its simplicity, and to that of the average railroad
director by its apparent cheapness. Any one could
understand it, and its first cost was temptingly
small. The real struggle in Great Britain, therefore,
has been, and now is, between these two brakes; and
the fact that both of them are American has been
made to enter largely into it, and in a way also
which at times lent to the discussion an element of
broad humor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>For instance, the energetic agent of the Smith
vacuum, feeling himself aggrieved by some statement
which appeared in the <cite>Times</cite>, responded thereto
in a circular, in the composition of which he certainly
evinced more zeal than either judgment or
literary skill. This circular and its author were then
referred to by the editors of <cite>Engineering</cite>, a London
scientific journal, in the following slightly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de haut
en bas</i> style:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is not a little remarkable, and it is a fact not harmonious
with the feelings of English engineers, that the
two brakes recommending themselves for adoption are of
American origin. * * * Now we cannot wonder,
considering what our past experience has been in many
of our dealings with Americans, that this feeling of distrust
and prejudice exists. It is not merely sentimental,
it is founded on many and untoward and costly experiences
of the past, and the fear of similar experiences in
the future. And when we see the representative of one
of these systems adopting the traditional policy of his
country, and meeting criticism with abuse&mdash;abuse of men
pre-eminent in the profession, and journals which he apparently
forgets are neither American nor venal&mdash;we do
not wonder that our railway engineers feel a repugnance
to commit themselves."</p></blockquote>

<p>The superiority of the British over the American
controversialist, as respects courtesy and restraint
in language, being thus satisfactorily established, it
only remained to illustrate it. This, however, had
already been done in the previous May; for at that
time it chanced that Captain Tyler, having retired
from his position at the head of the railway inspectors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
department of the Board of Trade, was considering
an offer which Mr. Westinghouse had made
him to associate himself with the company owning
the brakes known by that name. Before accepting
this offer, Captain Tyler took advantage of a meeting
of the Society of Arts to publicly give notice
that he was considering it. This he did in a really
admirable paper on the whole subject of continuous
brakes, at the close of which a general discussion
was invited and took place, and in the course of it
the innate superiority of the British over any other
kind of controversialist, so far at least as courtesy
and a delicate refraining from imputations is concerned,
received pointed illustration.</p>

<p>No sooner had Captain Tyler finished than Mr.
Houghton, C. E., took occasion to refer to the
paper he had read as "an elaborate puff to the
Westinghouse brake, with which he [Tyler] was, as
he told, connected, or about to be." Subsequently
Mr. Steele proceeded to say that:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On receiving the invitation to be present at the
meeting, he had been somewhat afraid that Captain
Tyler was going to lose his fine character for impartiality
by throwing in his lot with the brake-tinkers, but it came
out that not only was he going to do that, but actually
going to be a partner in a concern. * * * The
speaker then proceeded to discuss the Westinghouse
brake, which he called the Westinghouse and Tyler
brake, designating it as a jack-in-the-box, a rattle trap,
to please and decoy, and not an invention at all. No
engineer had a hand in its manufacture. It was the discovery
of some Philadelphia barber or some such thing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
He had spoken of honest brakes. This was a brake
which had all sorts of pretensions. It had not worked
well, but whenever there was any row about its not working
well, they got the papers to praise it up, and that was
how the papers were under the thumb, and would not
speak of any other. * * * He thought it would not
do for railway companies to take a bad brake, and Captain
Tyler and Mr. Westinghouse be able to make their
fortunes by floating a limited company for its introduction.
They had heard of Emma mines and Lisbon
tramways, and such like, and he felt it would not be well
to stand by and allow this to be done."</p></blockquote>

<p>All of which was not only to the point, but finely
calculated to show the American inventors and
agents who were present the nice and mutually
respectful manner in which such discussions were
carried on by all Englishmen.</p>

<p>Though the avowed adhesion of Sir Henry Tyler
to the Westinghouse was a most important move
in the war of the brakes, it did not prove a decisive
one. The complete control of the field was too
valuable a property to be yielded in deference to
that, or any other name without a struggle; and, so to
speak, there were altogether too many ins and outs
to the conflict. Back door influences had everywhere
to be encountered. The North Western, for
instance, is the most important of the railway companies
of the United Kingdom. The locomotive
superintendent of that company was the part inventor
and proprietor of an emergency brake which
had been extensively adopted by it on its rolling
stock, but which wholly failed to meet the requirements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
laid down in its circular by the Board
of Trade. Immediately after issuing that circular
the Board of Trade called the attention of the
company to this fact in connection with an accident
which had recently occurred, and in very
emphatic language pointed out that the brakes in
question could not "in any reasonable sense of
the word be called continuous brakes," and that it
was clear that the circular requirements were "not
complied with by the brake-system of the London
&amp; North Western Railway Company;" in case
that company persisted in the use of that brake,
the secretary of the Board went on to say, "in the
event of a casualty occurring, which an efficient
system of brakes might have prevented, a heavy
personal responsibility will rest upon those who are
answerable for such neglect." This was certainly
language tolerably direct in its import. As such it
was calculated to cause those to whom it was addressed
to pause in their action. The company,
however, treated it with a superb disregard, all the
more contemptuous because veiled in language of
deferential civility. They then quietly went on applying
their locomotive superintendent's emergency
brake to their equipment, until on the 30th of June,
1879, they returned no less than 2,052 carriages
fitted with it; that being by far the largest number
returned by any one company in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>A more direct challenge to the Board of Trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and to Parliament could not easily have been devised.
To appreciate how direct it was, it is necessary
to bear in mind that in its circular of August
30, 1877, in which the requirements of a satisfactory
train-brake were laid down, the Board of
Trade threw out to the companies the very significant
hint, that they "would do well to reflect that
if a doubt should arise that from a conflict of interest
or opinion, or from any other cause, they [the
companies] are not exerting themselves, it is obvious
that they will call down upon themselves an interference
which the Board of Trade, no less than the
companies, desire to avoid." In his general report
on the accidents of the year 1877, the successor of
Captain Tyler expressed the opinion that "sufficient
information and experience would now appear
to be available, and the time is approaching when
the railway companies may fairly be expected to
come to a decision as to which of the systems of
continuous brakes is best calculated to fulfil the
requisite conditions, and is most worthy of general
adoption." At the close of another year, however,
the official returns seemed to indicate that, while
but a sixth part of the passenger locomotives and a
fifth part of the carriages in use on the railroads of
the United Kingdom were yet equipped with continuous
brakes at all, a concurrence of opinion in
favor of any one system was more remote than
ever. During the six months ending December
31, 1878, but 127 additional locomotives out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
about 4000, and 1,200 additional carriages out of
some 32,000 were equipped; of which 70 locomotives
and 530 carriages had been equipped with
the Smith vacuum, which in three most important
respects failed to comply with the Board of Trade
requirements. Under these circumstances the Board
of Trade was obviously called upon either to withdraw
from the position it had taken, or to invite
that "interference" in its support to which in its
circular of August, 1877 it had so portentously referred.
It decided to do the latter, and in March,
1879 the government gave an intimation in the
House of Lords that early Parliamentary action
was contemplated. As it is expressed, the railway
companies are to "be relieved of their indecision."</p>

<p>In Great Britain, therefore, the long battle of the
brakes would seem to be drawing to its close. The
final struggle, however, will be a spirited one, and
one which Americans will watch with considerable
interest,&mdash;for it is in fact a struggle between two
American brakes, the Westinghouse and the Smith
vacuum. Of the 907 locomotives hitherto equipped
with the continuous brakes no less than 819 are
equipped with one or the other of these American
patents, besides over 4,464 of the 9,919 passenger
carriages. The remaining 3,857 locomotives and
30,000 carriages are the prize of victory. As the
score now stands the vacuum brake is in almost exactly
twice the use of its more scientific rival.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
The weight of authority and experience, and the
requirements of the Board of Trade, are, however,
on the opposite side.</p>

<p>As deduced from the European scientific tests and
the official returns, the balance of advantages would
seem to be as follows:&mdash;In favor of the vacuum
are its superficial simplicity, and possible economy
in first cost:&mdash;In favor of the Westinghouse automatic
are its superior quickness in application, the
greater rapidity in its stopping power, the more
durable nature of its materials, the smaller cost in
renewal, its less liability to derangement, and above
all its self-acting adjustment. The last is the point
upon which the final issue of the struggle must
probably turn. The use of any train-brake which
is not automatic in its action, as has already been
pointed out, involves in the long run disaster,&mdash;and
ultimate serious disaster. The mere fact that the
brake is generally so reliable,&mdash;that ninety-nine
times out of the hundred it works perfectly,&mdash;simply
makes disaster certain by the fatal confidence it
inspires. Ninety-nine times in a hundred the brake
proves reliable;&mdash;nine times in the remaining ten of
the thousand, in which it fails, a lucky chance averts
disaster;&mdash;but the thousandth time will assuredly
come, as it did at Communipaw and on the New
York Elevated railway, and, much the worst of all
yet, at Wollaston. Soon or late the use of non-automatic
continuous brakes will most assuredly, if
they are not sooner abandoned, be put an end to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
by the occurrence of some not-to-be forgotten catastrophe
of the first magnitude, distinctly traceable
to that cause. Meanwhile that automatic brakes
are complicated and sometimes cause inconvenience
in their operation is most indisputable. This is an
objection, also, to which they are open in common
with most of the riper results of human ingenuity;&mdash;but,
though sun-dials are charmingly simple, we
do not, therefore, discard chronometers in their
favor; neither do we insist on cutting our harvests
with the scythe, because every man who may be
called upon to drive a mowing machine may not
know how to put one together. But what Sir
Henry Tyler has said in respect to this oldest and
most fallacious, as well as most wearisome, of objections
covers the whole ground and cannot be
improved upon. After referring to the fact that
simplicity in construction and simplicity in working
were two different things, and that, almost invariably,
a certain degree of complication in construction
is necessary to secure simplicity in working,&mdash;after
pointing this out he went on to add that,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Simplicity as regards the application of railway brakes
is not obtained by the system now more commonly
employed of brake-handles to be turned by different men
in different parts of the train; but is obtained when, by
more complicated construction an engine-driver is able
easily in an instant to apply ample brake-power at pleasure
with more or less force to every wheel of his train;
is obtained when, every time an engine-driver starts, or
attempts to start his train, the brake itself informs him if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
it is out of order; and is still more obtained when, on
the occasion of an accident and the separation of a
coupling, the brakes will unfailingly apply themselves on
every wheel of the train without the action of the engine-driver
or guards, [brakemen], and before even they have
time to realize the necessity for it. This is true simplicity
in such a case, and that system of continuous
brakes which best accomplishes such results in the shortest
space of time is so far preferable to all others."</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>THE RAILROAD JOURNEY RESULTING IN DEATH.</h3>


<p>One day in May, 1847, as the Queen of Belgium
was going from Verviers to Brussels by rail, the
train in which she was journeying came into collision
with another train going in the opposite
direction. There was naturally something of a
panic, and, as royalty was not then accustomed to
being knocked about with railroad equality, some of
her suite urged the queen to leave the train and to
finish her journey by carriage. The contemporaneous
court reporter then went on to say, in that
language which is so peculiarly his own,&mdash;"But her
Majesty, as courageously as discreetly, declined to
set that example of timidity, and she proceeded to
Brussels by the railway." In those days a very exaggerated
idea was universally entertained of the
great danger incident to travel by rail. Even then,
however, had her Majesty, who was doubtless a very
sensible woman, happened to be familiar with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
statistics of injuries received by those traveling respectively
by rail and by carriage, she certainly never
on any plea of danger would have been induced to
abandon her railroad train in order to trust herself
behind horse-flesh. By pursuing the course urged
upon her, the queen would have multiplied her
chances of accident some sixty fold. Strange as the
statement sounds even now, such would seem to
have been the fact. In proportion to the whole
number carried, the accidents to passengers in "the
good old days of stage-coaches" were, as compared
to the present time of the railroad dispensation,
about as sixty to one. This result, it is true, cannot
be verified in the experience either of England or
of this country, for neither the English nor we possess
any statistics in relation to the earlier period;
but they have such statistics in France, stretching
over the space of more than forty years, and as reliable
as statistics ever are. If these French statistics
hold true in New England,&mdash;and considering the
character of our roads, conveyances, and climate,
their showing is more likely to be in our favor than
against us,&mdash;if they simply hold true, leaving us to
assume that stage-coach traveling was no less safe
in Massachusetts than in France, then it would follow
that to make the dangers of the rail of the present
day equal to those of the highway of half a
century back, some eighty passengers should annually
be killed and some eleven hundred injured
within the limits of Massachusetts alone. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
figures, however, represent rather more than fifty
times the actual average, and from them it would
seem to be not unfair to conclude that, notwithstanding
the great increase of population and the
yet greater increase in travel during the last half-century,
there were literally more persons killed and
injured each year in Massachusetts fifty years ago
through accidents to stage-coaches than there are
now through accidents to railroad trains.</p>

<p>The first impression of nine out of ten persons in
no way connected with the operations of railroads
would probably be found to be the exact opposite
to this. A vague but deeply rooted conviction commonly
prevails that the railroad has created a new
danger; that because of it the average human
being's hold on life is more precarious than it was.
The first point-blank, bald statement to the contrary
would accordingly strike people in the light not only
of a paradox, but of a somewhat foolish one. Investigation,
nevertheless, bears it out. The fact is
that when a railroad accident comes, it is apt to
come in such a way as to leave no doubt whatever
in relation to it. It is heralded like a battle or an
earthquake; it fills columns of the daily press with
the largest capitals and the most harrowing details,
and thus it makes a deep and lasting impression on
the minds of many people. When a multitude of
persons, traveling as almost every man now daily
travels himself, meet death in such sudden and such
awful shape, the event smites the imagination. People<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
seeing it and thinking of it, and hearing and
reading of it, and of it only, forget of how infrequent
occurrence it is. It was not so in the olden time.
Every one rode behind horses,&mdash;if not in public then
in private conveyances,&mdash;and when disaster came it
involved but few persons and was rarely accompanied
by circumstances which either struck the imagination
or attracted any great public notice. In the
first place, the modern newspaper, with its perfect
machinery for sensational exaggeration, did not then
exist,&mdash;having itself only recently come in the train
of the locomotive;&mdash;and, in the next place, the circle
of those included in the consequences of any disaster
was necessarily small. It is far otherwise now.
For weeks and months the vast machinery moves
along, doing its work quickly, swiftly, safely; no one
pays any attention to it, while millions daily make
use of it. It is as much a necessity of their lives as
the food they eat and the air they breathe. Suddenly,
somehow, and somewhere,&mdash;at Versailles, at
Norwalk, at Abergele, at New Hamburg, or at Revere,&mdash;at
some hitherto unfamiliar point upon an insignificant
thread of the intricate iron web, an obstruction
is encountered, a jar, as it were, is felt, and
instantly, with time for hardly an ejaculation or a
thought, a multitude of human beings are hurled
into eternity. It is no cause for surprise that such
an event makes the community in which it happens
catch its breadth; neither is it unnatural that people
should think more of the few who are killed, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
whom they hear so much, than of the myriads who
are carried in safety and of whom they hear nothing.
Yet it is well to bear in mind that there are two sides
to that question also, and in no way could this fact
be more forcibly brought to our notice than by the
assertion, borne out by all the statistics we possess,
that, irrespective of the vast increase in the number
of those who travel, a greater number of passengers
in stage-coaches were formerly each year killed or
injured by accidents to which they in no way contributed
through their own carelessness, than are
now killed under the same conditions in our railroad
cars. In other words, the introduction of the modern
railroad, so far from proportionately increasing
the dangers of traveling, has absolutely diminished
them. It is not, after all, the dangers but the safety
of the modern railroad which should excite our
special wonder.</p>

<p>What is the average length of the railroad journey
resulting in death by accident to a prudent
traveler?&mdash;What is the average length of one resulting
in some personal injury to him?&mdash;These are
two questions which interest every one. Few persons,
probably, start upon any considerable journey,
implying days and nights on the rail, without almost
unconsciously taking into some consideration
the risks of accident. Visions of collision, derailment,
plunging through bridges, will rise unbidden.
Even the old traveler who has enjoyed a long immunity
is apt at times, with some little apprehension,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
to call to mind the musty adage of the pitcher
and the well, and to ask himself how much longer
it will be safe for him to rely on his good luck. A
hundred thousand miles, perhaps, and no accident
yet!&mdash;Surely, on every doctrine of chances, he now
owes to fate an arm or a leg;&mdash;perhaps a life.
The statistics of a long series of years enable us,
however, to approximate with a tolerable degree of
precision to an answer to these questions, and the
answer is simply astounding;&mdash;so astounding, in
fact, that, before undertaking to give it, the question
itself ought to be stated with all possible
precision. It is this:&mdash;Taking all persons who as
passengers travel by rail,&mdash;and this includes all
dwellers in civilized countries,&mdash;what number of
journeys of the average length are safely accomplished,
to each one which results in the death
or injury of a passenger from some cause over
which he had no control?&mdash;The cases of death or
injury must be confined to passengers, and to those
of them only who expose themselves to no unnecessary
risk.</p>

<p>When approaching a question of this sort, statisticians
are apt to assume for their answers an appearance
of mathematical accuracy. It is needless
to say that this is a mere affectation. The best results
which can be arrived at are, after all, mere
approximations, and they also vary greatly year by
year. The body of facts from which conclusions are
to be deduced must cover not only a definite area<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
of space, but also a considerable lapse of time.
Even Great Britain, with its 17,000 miles of track
and its hundreds of millions of annual passenger
journeys, shows results which, one year with another,
vary strangely. For instance, during the four years
anterior to 1874, but one passenger was killed,
upon an average, to each 11,000,000 carried; while
in 1874 the proportion, under the influence of a
succession of disasters, suddenly doubled, rising to
one in every 5,500,000; and then again in 1877, a
year of peculiar exemption, it fell off to one in every
50,000,000. The percentage of fatal casualties to
the whole number carried was in 1847-9 five fold
what it was in 1878. If such fluctuations reveal
themselves in the statistics of Great Britain, those
met with in the narrower field of a single state in
this country might well seem at first glance to set
all computation at defiance. During the ten years,
for example, between 1861 and 1870, about
200,000,000 passengers were returned as carried on
the Massachusetts roads, with 135 cases of injury to
individuals. Then came the year of the Revere
disaster, and out of 26,000,000 carried, no less than
115 were killed or injured. Seven years of comparative
immunity then ensued, during which, out of
240,000,000 carried, but two were killed and forty-five
injured. In other words, through a period of ten
years the casualties were approximately as one to
1,500,000; then during a single year they rose to
one in 250,000, or a seven-fold increase; and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
through a period of seven years they diminished to
one in 3,400,000, a decrease of about ninety per
cent.</p>

<p>Taking, however, the very worst of years,&mdash;the
year of the Revere disaster, which stands unparalleled
in the history of Massachusetts,&mdash;it will yet
be found that the answer to the question as to
the length of the average railroad journey resulting
in death or in injury will be expressed, not in
thousands nor in hundreds of thousands of miles,
but in millions. During that year some 26,000,000
passenger journeys were made within the limits of
the state, and each journey averaged a distance of
about 13 miles. It would seem, therefore, that,
even in that year, the average journey resulting in
death was 11,000,000 miles, while that resulting
either in death or personal injury was not less
than 3,300,000.</p>

<p>The year 1871, however, represented by no
means a fair average. On the contrary, it indicated
what may fairly be considered an excessive
degree of danger, exciting nervous apprehensions
in the breasts of those even who were not constitutionally
timid. To reach what may be considered
a normal average, therefore, it would be more
proper to include a longer period in the computation.
Take, for instance, the nine years, 1871-79,
during which alone has any effort been made to
reach statistical accuracy in respect to Massachusetts
railroad accidents. During those nine years, speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
in round numbers and making no pretence
at anything beyond a general approximation, some
303,000,000 passenger journeys of 13 miles each
have been made on the railroads and within the
state. Of these 51 have resulted in death and 308
in injuries to persons from causes over which they
had no control. The average distance, therefore,
traveled by all, before death happened to any
one, was about 80,000,000 miles, and that travelled
before any one was either injured or killed was
about 10,800,000.</p>

<p>The Revere disaster of 1871, however, as has
been seen, brought about important changes in the
methods of operating the railroads of Massachusetts.
Consequently the danger incident to railroad
traveling was materially reduced; and in the next
eight years (1872-9) some 274,000,000 passenger
journeys were made within the limits of the state.
The Wollaston disaster of October, 1878, was included
in this period, during which 223 persons
were injured and 21 were killed. The average
journey for these years resulting in any injury to a
passenger was close upon 15,000,000 miles, while
that resulting in death was 170,000,000.</p>

<p>But it may fairly be asked,&mdash;What, after all, do
these figures mean?&mdash;They are, indeed, so large as
to exceed comprehension; for, after certain comparatively
narrow limits are passed the practical infinite
is approached, and the mere adding of a few more
ciphers after a numeral conveys no new idea. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the contrary, the piling up of figures rather tends to
weaken than to strengthen a statement, for to many
it suggests an idea of ridiculous exaggeration. Indeed,
when a few years ago a somewhat similar
statement to that just made was advanced in an
official report, a critic undertook to expose the
fallacy of it in the columns of a daily paper by referring
to a case within the writer's own observation
in which a family of three persons had been killed
on their very first journey in a railroad car. It is
not, of course, necessary to waste time over such a
criticism as this. Railroad accidents continually
take place, and in consequence of them people are
killed and injured, and of these there may well be
some who are then making their first journey by
rail; but in estimating the dangers of railroad traveling
the much larger number who are not killed or
injured at all must likewise be taken into consideration.
Any person as he may be reading this page in
a railroad car may be killed or injured through some
accident, even while his eye is glancing over the figures
which show how infinitesimal his danger is; but
the chances are none the less as a million to one
that any particular reader will go down to his grave
uninjured by any accident on the rail, unless it be
occasioned by his or her own carelessness.</p>

<p>Admitting, therefore, that ill luck or hard fortune
must fall to the lot of certain unascertainable persons,
yet the chances of incurring that ill fortune
are so small that they are not materially increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
by any amount of traveling which can be accomplished
within the limits of a human life. So far
from exhausting a fair average immunity from accident
by constant traveling, the statistics of Massachusetts
during the last eight years would seem to
indicate that if any given person were born upon a
railroad car, and remained upon it traveling 500
miles a day all his life, he would, with average good
fortune, be somewhat over 80 years of age before
he would be involved in any accident resulting in
his death or personal injury, while he would attain
the highly respectable age of 930 years before being
killed. Even supposing that the most exceptional
average of the Revere year became usual,
a man who was killed by an accident at 70 years of
age should, unless he were fairly to be accounted
unlucky, have accomplished a journey of some 440
miles every day of his life, Sundays included,
from the time of his birth to that of his death;
while even to have brought him within the fair liability
of any injury at all, his daily journey should
have been some 120 miles. Under the conditions
of the last eight years his average daily journey
through the three score years and ten to entitle him
to be killed in an accident at the end of them
would be about 600 miles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3>THE RAILROAD DEATH RATE.</h3>


<p>In connection with the statistics of railroad
casualties it is not without interest to examine
the general vital statistics of some considerable
city, for they show clearly enough what a large degree
of literal truth there was in the half jocose
proposition attributed to John Bright, that the
safest place in which a man could put himself
was inside a first-class railroad carriage of a train
in full motion. Take the statistics of Boston, for
instance, for the year 1878. During the four years
1875-8, it will be remembered, a single passenger
only was killed on the railroads of Massachusetts
in consequence of an accident to which he by his
own carelessness in no way contributed.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The
average number of persons annually injured, not
fatally, during those years was about five.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>
<p>Yet during the year 1878, excluding all cases of
mere injury of which no account was made, no
less than 53 persons came to their deaths in Boston
from falling down stairs, and 37 more from falling
out of windows; seven were scalded to death in
1878 alone. In the year 1874 seventeen were killed
by being run over by teams in the streets, while
the pastime of coasting was carried on at a cost of
ten lives more. During the five years 1874-8 there
were more persons murdered in the city of Boston
alone than lost their lives as passengers through the
negligence of all the railroad corporations in the
whole state of Massachusetts during the nine years
1871-8; though in those nine years were included
both the Revere and the Wollaston disasters, the
former of which resulted in the death of 29, and
the latter of 21 persons. Neither are the comparative
results here stated in any respect novel or peculiar
to Massachusetts. Years ago it was officially
announced in France that people were less safe in
their own houses than while traveling on the railroads;
and, in support of this somewhat startling
proposition, statistics were produced showing fourteen
cases of death of persons remaining at home
and there falling over carpets, or, in the case of females,
having their garments catch fire, to ten deaths
on the rail. Even the game of cricket counted
eight victims to the railroad's ten.</p>

<p>It will not, of course, be inferred that the cases
of death or injury to passengers from causes beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
their control include by any means all the casualties
involved in the operation of the railroad system.
On the contrary, they include but a very small portion
of them. The experience of the Massachusetts
roads during the seven years between September
30, 1871, and September 30, 1878, may again be
cited in reference to this point. During that time
there were but 52 cases of injury to passengers
from causes over which they had no control, but in
connection with the entire working of the railroad
system no less than 1,900 cases of injury were reported,
of which 1,008 were fatal; an average of 144
deaths a year. Of these cases, naturally, a large
proportion were employés, whose occupation not
only involves much necessary risk, but whose familiarity
with risk causes them always to incur it even
in the most unnecessary and foolhardy manner.
During the seven years 293 of them were killed and
375 were reported as injured. Nor is it supposed
that the list included by any means all the cases of
injury which occurred. About one half of the accidents
to employés are occasioned by their falling
from the trains when in motion, usually from freight
trains and in cold weather, and from being crushed
between cars while engaged in coupling them
together. From this last cause alone an average
of 27 casualties are annually reported. One fact,
however, will sufficiently illustrate how very difficult
it is to protect this class of men from danger,
or rather from themselves. As is well known, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
freight trains they are obliged to ride on the tops of
the cars; but these are built so high that their roofs
come dangerously near the bottoms of the highway
bridges, which cross the track sometimes in close
proximity to each other. Accordingly many unfortunate
brakemen were killed by being knocked
off the trains as they passed under these bridges.
With a view to affording the utmost possible protection
against this form of accident, a statute was
passed by the Massachusetts legislature compelling
the corporations to erect guards at a suitable distance
from every overhead bridge which was less
than eighteen feet in the clear above the track.
These guards were so arranged as to swing lightly
across the tops of the cars, giving any one standing
upon them a sharp rap, warning him of the danger
he was in. This warning rap, however, so annoyed
the brakemen that the guards were on a number of
the roads systematically destroyed as often as they
were put up; so that at last another law had to be
passed, making their destruction a criminal offense.
The brakemen themselves resisted the attempt to
divest their perilous occupation of one of its most
insidious dangers.</p>

<p>In this respect, however, brakemen differ in no
degree from the rest of the community. On all
hands railroad accidents seem to be systematically
encouraged, and the wonder is that the list of casualties
is not larger. In Massachusetts, for instance,
even in the most crowded portions of the largest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
cities and towns, not only do the railroads cross the
highways at grade, but whenever new thoroughfares
are laid out the people of the neighborhood almost
invariably insist upon their crossing the railroads at
a grade and not otherwise. Not but that, upon
theory and in the abstract, every one is opposed to
grade-crossings; but those most directly concerned
always claim that their particular crossing is exceptional
in character. In vain do corporations protest
and public officials argue; when the concrete case
arises all neighborhoods become alike and strenuously
insist on their right to incur everlasting danger
rather than to have the level of their street broken.
During the last seven years to September 30, 1878,
191 persons have been injured, and 98 of them fatally
injured, at these crossings in Massachusetts,
and it is certain as fate that the number is destined
to annually increase. What the result in a remote
future will be, it is not now easy to forecast. One
thing only would seem certain: the time will come
when the two classes of traffic thus recklessly made
to cross each other will at many points have to
be separated, no matter at what cost to the community
which now challenges the danger it will then
find itself compelled to avoid.</p>

<p>The heaviest and most regular cause of death and
injury involved in the operation of the railroad system
yet remains to be referred to; and again it is
recklessness which is at the root of it, and this time
recklessness in direct violation of law. The railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
tracks are everywhere favorite promenades, and apparently
even resting-places, especially for those
who are more or less drunk. In Great Britain physical
demolition by a railroad train is also a somewhat
favorite method of committing suicide, and that, too,
in the most deliberate and cool-blooded manner.
Cases have not been uncommon in which persons
have been seen to coolly lay themselves down in
front of an advancing train, and very neatly effect
their own decapitation by placing their necks across
the rail. In England alone, during the last seven
years, there have been no less than 280 cases of
death reported under the head of suicides, or an
average of 40 each year, the number in 1878 rising
to 60. In America these cases are not returned in
a class by themselves. Under the general head of
accidents to trespassers, however, that is, accidents
to men, women and children, especially the latter,
illegally lying, walking, or playing on the tracks
or riding upon the cars,&mdash;under this head are regularly
classified more than one third of all the casualties
incident to working the Massachusetts railroads.
During the last seven years these have
amounted to an aggregate of 724 cases of injury, no
less than 494 of which were fatal. Of course, very
many other cases of this description, which were not
fatal, were never reported. And here again the
recklessness of the public has received further illustration,
and this time in a very unpleasant way.
Certain corporations operating roads terminating in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Boston endeavored at one time to diminish this
slaughter by enforcing the laws against walking on
railroad tracks. A few trespassers were arrested and
fined, and then the resentment of those whose
wonted privileges were thus interfered with began
to make itself felt. Obstructions were found placed
in the way of night trains. The mere attempt to
keep people from risking their lives by getting in
the way of locomotives placed whole trains full of
passengers in imminent jeopardy.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, however, by far the most effective
means of keeping railroad tracks from becoming
foot-paths, and thus at once putting an end to the
largest item in the grand total of the expenditure of
life incident to the operation of railroads, is that
secured by the Pennsylvania railroad as an unintentional
corollary to its method of ballasting.
That superb organization, every detail of whose
wonderful system is a fit subject for study to all
interested in the operation of railroads, has a roadway
peculiar to itself. A principal feature in this is
a surface of broken stone ballast, covering not only
the space between the rails, but also the interval
between the tracks as well as the road-bed on the
outside of each track for a distance of some three
feet. It resembles nothing so much as a newly
macadamized highway. That, too, is its permanent
condition. To walk on the sharp and uneven edges
of this broken stone is possible, with a sufficient
expenditure of patience and shoe-leather; but certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
no human being would ever walk there from
preference, or if any other path could be found. Not
only is it in itself, as a system of ballasting, looked
upon as better than any other, but it confounds the
tramp. Its systematic adoption in crowded, suburban
neighborhoods would, therefore, answer a
double purpose. It would secure to the corporations
permanent road-beds exclusively for their own
use, and obviate the necessity of arrests or futile
threats to enforce the penalties of the law against
trespassers. It seems singular that this most obvious
and effective way of putting a stop to what is both
a nuisance and a danger has not yet been resorted
to by men familiar with the use of spikes and
broken glass on the tops of fences and walls.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, taken even in its largest aggregate,
the loss of life incident to the working of the railroad
system is not excessive, nor is it out of proportion
to what might reasonably be expected. It is
to be constantly borne in mind, not only that the
railroad performs a great function in modern life,
but that it also and of necessity performs it in a very
dangerous way. A practically irresistible force
crashing through the busy hive of modern civilization
at a wild rate of speed, going hither and
thither, across highways and by-ways and along a
path which is in itself a thoroughfare,&mdash;such an
agency cannot be expected to work incessantly and
yet never to come in contact with the human frame.
Naturally, however, it might be a very car of Juggernaut.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Is it so in fact?&mdash;To demonstrate that it is
not, it is but necessary again to recur to the comparison
between the statistics of railroad accidents and
those which necessarily occur in the experience of
all considerable cities. Take again those of Boston
and of the railroad system of Massachusetts. These
for the purpose of illustration are as good as any,
and in their results would only be confirmed in the
experience of Paris as compared with the railroad
system of France, or in that of London as compared
with the railroad system of Great Britain. During
the eight years between September 30, 1870, and
September 30, 1878, the entire railroad system of
Massachusetts was operated at a cost of 1,165 lives,
apart from all cases of injury which did not prove
fatal. The returns in this respect also may be
accepted as reasonably accurate, as the deaths were
all returned, though the cases of merely personal
injury probably were not. The annual average was
146 lives. During the ten years, 1868-78, 2,587
cases of death from accidental causes, or 259 a year,
were recorded as having taken place in the city of
Boston. In other words, the annual average of
deaths by accident in the city of Boston alone exceeds
that consequent on running all the railroads
of the state by eighty per cent. Unless, therefore,
the railroad system is to be considered as an exception
to all other functions of modern life, and as
such is to be expected to do its work without injury
to life or limb, this showing does not constitute a
very heavy indictment against it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3>AMERICAN AS COMPARED WITH FOREIGN RAILROAD
ACCIDENTS.</h3>


<p>Up to this point, the statistics and experience of
Massachusetts only have been referred to. This is
owing to the fact that the railroad returns of that
state are more carefully prepared and tabulated than
are those of any other state, and afford, therefore,
more satisfactory data from which to draw conclusions.
The territorial area from which the statistics
are in this case derived is very limited, and it yet
remains to compare the results deduced from them
with those derived from the similar experience of
other communities. This, however, is not an easy
thing to do; and, while it is difficult enough as respects
Europe, it is even more difficult as respects
America taken as a whole. This last fact is especially
unfortunate in view of the circumstance
that, in regard to railway accidents, the United
States, whether deservedly or not, enjoy a most
undesirable reputation. Foreign authorities have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
way of referring to our "well-known national disregard
of human life," with a sort of complacency,
at once patronizing and contemptuous, which
is the reverse of pleasing. Judging by the tone
of their comments, the natural inference would
be that railroad disasters of the worst description
were in America matters of such frequent occurrence
as to excite scarcely any remark. As will
presently be made very apparent, this impression,
for it is only an impression, can, so far as the
country as a whole is concerned, neither be proved
nor disproved, from the absence of sufficient data
from which to argue. As respects Massachusetts,
however, and the same statement may perhaps
be made of the whole belt of states north of the
Potomac and the Ohio, there is no basis for it.
There is no reason to suppose that railroad traveling
is throughout that region accompanied by any
peculiar or unusual degree of danger.</p>

<p>The great difficulty, just referred to, in comparing
the results deduced from equally complete statistics
of different countries, lies in the variety of the arbitrary
rules under which the computations in making
them up are effected. As an example in point, take
the railroad returns of Great Britain and those of
Massachusetts. They are in each case prepared
with a great deal of care, and the results deduced
from them may fairly be accepted as approximately
correct. As respects accidents, the number of
cases of death and of personal injury are annually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
reported, and with tolerable completeness, though in
the latter respect there is probably in both cases
room for improvement. The whole comparison
turns, however, on the way in which the entire
number of passengers annually carried is computed.
In Great Britain, for instance, in 1878, these were
returned, using round numbers only, at 565,000,000,
and in Massachusetts at 34,000,000. By dividing
these totals by the number of cases of death and
injury reported as occurring to passengers from
causes beyond their control, we shall arrive apparently
at a fair comparative showing as to the relative
safety of railroad traveling in the two communities.
The result for that particular year would have been
that while in Great Britain one passenger in each
23,500,000 was killed, and one in each 481,600 injured
from causes beyond their control, in Massachusetts
none were killed and only one in each
14,000,000 was in any way injured. Unfortunately,
however, a closer examination reveals a very great
error in the computation, affecting every comparative
result drawn from it. In the English returns
no allowance whatever is made for the very large
number of journeys made by season-ticket or commutation
passengers, while in Massachusetts, on the
contrary, each person of this class enters into the
grand total as making two trips each day, 156 trips
on each quarterly ticket, and 626 trips on each annual.
Now in 1878 more than 418,000 holders of
season tickets were returned by the railway companies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
of Great Britain. How many of these were
quarterly and how many were annual travelers, does
not appear. If they were all annual travelers, no
less than 261,000,000 journeys should be added to the
565,000,000 in the returns, in order to arrive at an
equal basis for a comparison between the foreign
and the American roads: this method, however,
would be manifestly inaccurate, so it only remains,
in the absence of all reliable data, and for the purpose
of comparison solely, to strike out from the
Massachusetts returns the 8,320,727 season-ticket
passages, which at once reduces by over 3,000,000
the number of journeys to each case of injury. As
season-ticket passengers do travel and are exposed
to danger in the same degree as trip-ticket passengers,
no result is approximately accurate which
leaves them out of the computation. At present,
however, the question relates not to the positive
danger or safety of traveling by rail, but to its relative
danger in different communities.</p>

<p>Allowance for this discrepancy can, however,
be made by adding to the English official results
an additional nineteen per cent., that, according to
the returns of 1877 and 1878, being the proportion
of the season-ticket to other passengers on the
roads of Great Britain. Taking then the Board of
Trade returns for the eight years 1870-7, it will be
found that during this period about one passenger
in each 14,500,000 carried in that country has been
killed in railroad accidents, and about one in each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
436,000 injured. This may be assumed as a fair
average for purpose of comparison, though it ought
to be said that in Great Britain the percentage of
casualties to passengers shows a decided tendency
to decrease, and during the years 1877-8 the percentages
of killed fell from one in 15,000,000 to one
in 38,000,000 and those of injured from one in
436,000 to one in 766,000. The aggregates from
which these results are deduced are so enormous,
rising into the thousands of millions, that a certain
degree of reliance can be placed on them. In the
case of Massachusetts, however, the entire period
during which the statistics are entitled to the slightest
weight includes only eight years, 1872-9, and
offers an aggregate of but 274,000,000 journeys, or
but about forty per cent. of those included in the
British returns of the single year 1878. During
these years the killed in Massachusetts were one
in each 13,000,000 and the injured one in each 1,230,000;&mdash;or,
while the killed in the two cases were very
nearly in the same proportion,&mdash;respectively one in
14.5, and one in 13, speaking in millions,&mdash;the British
injured were really three to one of the Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The equality as respects the killed in this comparison,
and the marked discrepancy as respects the injured
is calculated at first sight to throw doubts on
the fullness of the Massachusetts returns. There
seems no good reason why the injured should in the
one case be so much more numerous than in the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
This, however, is susceptible on closer examination
of a very simple and satisfactory explanation. In
case of accident the danger of sustaining slight personal
injury is not so great in Massachusetts as in
Great Britain. This is due to the heavier and more
solid construction of the American passenger
coaches, and their different interior arrangement.
This fact, and the real cause of the large number
of slightly injured,&mdash;"shaken" they call it,&mdash;in the
English railroad accidents is made very apparent in
the following extract from Mr. Calcroft's report for
1877;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is no doubt a fact that collisions and other accidents
to railway trains are attended with less serious consequences
in proportion to the solidity of construction of
passenger carriages. The accomodation and internal
arrangements of third-class carriages, however, especially
those used in ordinary trains, are defective as regards
safety and comfort, as compared with many carriages of
the same class on foreign railways. The first-class passenger,
except when thrown against his opposite companion,
or when some luggage falls upon him, is generally
saved from severe contusion by the well-stuffed or padded
linings of the carriages; whilst the second-class and third-class
passenger is generally thrown with violence against
the hard wood-work. If the second and third-class carriages
had a high padded back lining, extending above
the head of the passenger, it would probably tend to lesson
the danger to life and limb which, as the returns of
accidents show, passengers in carriages of this class are
much exposed to in train accidents."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1878 the passenger journeys made in the
second and third class carriages of the United
Kingdom were thirteen to one of those made
in first class carriages;&mdash;or, expressed in millions,
there were but 41 of the latter to 523 of the former.
There can be very little question indeed that if, during
the last ten years, thirteen out of fourteen of the
passengers on Massachusetts railroads had been carried
in narrow compartments with wooden seats and
unlined sides the number of those returned as
slightly injured in the numerous accidents which
occurred would have been at least three-fold larger
than it was. If it had not been ten-fold larger it
would have been surprising.</p>

<p>The foregoing comparison, relates however, simply
to passengers killed in accidents for which they
are in no degree responsible. When, however, the
question reverts to the general cost in life and
limb at which the railroad systems are worked and
the railroad traffic is carried on to the entire communities
served, the comparison is less favorable to
Massachusetts. Taking the eight years of 1871-8,
the British returns include 30,641 cases of injury,
and 9,113 of death; while those of Massachusetts for
the same years included 1,165 deaths, with only
1,044 cases of injury; in the one case a total of
39,745 casualties, as compared with 2,209 the
other. It will, however be noticed that while in the
British returns the cases of injury are nearly three-fold
those of death, in the Massachusetts returns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the deaths exceed the cases of injury. This fact in
the present case cannot but throw grave suspicion
on the completeness of the Massachusetts returns.
As a matter of practical experience it is well known
that cases of injury almost invariably exceed those
of death, and the returns in which the disproportion
is greatest, if no sufficient explanation presents itself,
are probably the most full and reliable. Taking,
therefore, the deaths in the two cases as the better
basis for comparison, it will be found that the roads
of Great Britain in the grand result accomplished
seventeen-fold the work of those of Massachusetts
with less than eight times as many casualties; had
the proportion between the results accomplished and
the fatal injuries inflicted been maintained, but 536
deaths instead of 1,165 would have appeared in the
Massachusetts returns. The reason of this difference
in result is worth looking for, and fortunately
the statistical tables are in both cases carried sufficiently
into detail to make an analysis possible; and
this analysis, when made, seems to indicate very
clearly that while, for those directly connected with
the railroads, either as passengers or as employés,
the Massachusetts system in its working involves
relatively a less degree of danger than that of Great
Britain, yet for the outside community it involves
very much more. Take, for instance, the two heads
of accidents at grade-crossings and accidents to trespassers,
which have been already referred to. In
Great Britain highway grade-crossings are discouraged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
In Massachusetts they are practically insisted
upon. The results of the policy pursued may in
each case be read with sufficient distinctness in the
bills of mortality. During the years 1872-7, of
1,929 casualties to persons on the railroads of Massachusetts,
no less than 200 occurred at highway
grade crossings. Had the accidents of this description
in Great Britain been equally numerous in proportion
to the larger volume of the traffic of that
country, they would have resulted in over 3,000
cases of death or personal injury; they did in fact
result in 586 such cases. In Massachusetts, again,
to walk at will on any part of a railroad track is
looked upon as a sort of prescriptive and inalienable
right of every member of the community, irrespective
of age, sex, color, or previous condition of servitude.
Accordingly, during the six years referred
to, this right was exercised at the cost of life or limb
to 591 persons,&mdash;one in four of all the casualties
which occurred in connection with the railroad system.
In Great Britain the custom of using the
tracks of railroads as a foot-path seems to exist, but,
so far from being regarded as a right, it is practiced
in perpetual terror of the law. Accordingly, instead
of some 9,000 cases of death or injury from this
cause during these six years, which would have
been the proportion under like conditions in Massachusetts,
the returns showed only 2,379. These
two are among the most constant and fruitful causes
of accident in connection with the railroad system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of America. In great Britain their proportion to
the whole number of casualties which take place is
scarcely a seventh part of what it is in Massachusetts.
Here they constitute very nearly fifty per cent. of all
the accidents which occur; there they constitute
but a little over seven. There is in this comparison
a good deal of solid food for legislative thought, if
American legislators would but take it in; for this
is one matter the public policy in regard to which
can only be fixed by law.</p>

<p>When we pass from Great Britain to the continental
countries of Europe, the difficulties in the
way of any fair comparison of results become
greater and greater. The statistics do not enter
sufficiently into detail, nor is the basis of computation
apparent. It is generally conceded that,
where a due degree of caution is exercised by
the passenger, railroad traveling in continental
countries is attended with a much less degree of
danger than in England. When we come to the
returns, they hardly bear out this conclusion;
at least to the degree commonly supposed. Take
France, for example. Nowhere is human life more
carefully guarded than in that country; yet their
returns show that of 866,000,000 passengers transported
on the French railroads during the eleven
years 1859-69, no less than 65 were killed and 1,285
injured from causes beyond their control; or one in
each 13,000,000 killed as compared with one in
10,700,000 in Great Britain; and one in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
674,000 injured as compared with one in each
330,000 in the other country. During the single
year 1859, about 111,000,000 passengers were carried
on the French lines, at a general cost to the
community of 2,416 casualties, of which 295 were
fatal. In Massachusetts, during the four years
1871-74, about 95,000,000 passengers were carried,
at a reported cost of 1,158 casualties. This showing
might well be considered favorable to Massachusetts
did not the single fact that her returns included
more than twice as many deaths as the
French, with only a quarter as many injuries, make
it at once apparent that the statistics were at fault.
Under these circumstances comparison could only
be made between the numbers of deaths reported;
which would indicate that, in proportion to the
work done, the railroad operations of Massachusetts
involved about twice and a half more cases of injury
to life and limb than those of the French service.
As respects Great Britain the comparison is
much more favorable, the returns showing an almost
exactly equal general death-rate in the two countries
in proportion to their volumes of traffic; the volume
of Great Britain being about four times that
of France, while its death-rate by railroad accidents
was as 1,100 to 295.</p>

<p>With the exception of Belgium, however, in which
country the returns cover only the lines operated by
the state, the basis hardly exists for a useful comparison
between the dangers of injury from accident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
on the continental railroads and on those of Great
Britain and America. The several systems are operated
on wholly different principles, to meet the
needs of communities between whose modes of life
and thought little similarity exists. The continental
trains are far less crowded than either the
English or the American, and, when accidents occur,
fewer persons are involved in them. The
movement, also, goes on under much stricter regulation
and at lower rates of speed, so that there is a
grain of truth in the English sarcasm that on a German
railway "it almost seems as if beer-drinking
at the stations were the principal business, and
traveling a mere accessory."</p>

<p>Limiting, therefore, the comparison to the railroads
of Great Britain, it remains to be seen whether the
evil reputation of the American roads as respects accidents
is wholly deserved. Is it indeed true that
the danger to a passenger's life and limbs is so much
greater in this country than elsewhere?&mdash;Locally,
and so far as Massachusetts at least is concerned, it
certainly is not. How is it with the country taken
as a whole?&mdash;The lack of all reliable statistics as respects
this wide field of inquiry has already been referred
to. We have no trustworthy data. We do
not know with accuracy even the number of miles
of road operated; much less the number of passengers
annually carried. As respects accidents, and
the deaths and injuries resulting therefrom, some
information may be gathered from a careful and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
valuable, because the only record which has been
preserved during the last six years in the columns of
the <cite>Railroad Gazette</cite>. It makes, of course, no pretence
at either official accuracy or fullness, but it is
as complete probably as circumstances will permit
of its being made. During the five years 1874-8
there have been included in this record 4,846 accidents,
resulting in 1,160 deaths and 4,650 cases of
injury;&mdash;being an average of 969 accidents a year,
resulting in 232 deaths and 930 cases of injury.
These it will be remembered are casualties directly
resulting either to passengers or employés from train
accidents. No account is taken of injuries sustained
by employés in the ordinary operation of the roads,
or by members of the community not passengers.
In Massachusetts the accidents to passengers and
employés constitute one-half of the whole, but a
very small portion of the injuries reported as sustained
by either passengers or employés are the consequence
of train accidents,&mdash;not one in three in the
case of passengers or one in seven in that of employés.
In fact, of the 2,350 accidents to persons
reported in Massachusetts in the nine years 1870-8,
but 271, or less than twelve per cent., belonged to
the class alone included in the reports of the <cite>Railroad
Gazette</cite>. In England during the four years
1874-7 the proportion was larger, being about twenty-five
instead of twelve per cent. For America at
large the Massachusetts proportion is undoubtedly
the most nearly correct, and the probabilities would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
seem to be that the annual average of injuries to persons
incident to operating the railroads of the United
States is not less than 10,000, of which at least 1,200
are due to train accidents. Of these about two-thirds
may be set down as sustained by passengers,
or, approximately, 800 a year.</p>

<p>It remains to be ascertained what proportion this
number bears to the whole number carried. There
are no reliable statistics on this head any more than
on the other. Nothing but an approximation of the
most general character is possible. The number of
passengers annually carried on the roads of a few of
the states is reported with more or less accuracy,
and averaging these the result would seem to indicate
that there are certainly not more than 350,000,000
passengers annually carried on the roads of all
the states. There is something barbarous about
such an approximation, and it is disgraceful that at
this late day we should in America be forced to estimate
the passenger movement on our railroads in
much the same way that we guess at the population
of Africa. Such, however, is the case. We are in
this respect far in the rear of civilized communities.
Taking, however, 350,000,000 as a fair approximation
to our present annual passenger movement,
it will be observed that it is as nearly as may
be half that of Great Britain. In Great Britain, in
1878, there were 1,200 injuries to passengers from
accidents to trains, and 675 in 1877. The average
of the last eight years has been 1,226. If, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the approximation of 800 a year for America is at
all near the truth, the percentage would seem to be
considerably larger than that arrived at from the statistics
of Great Britain. Meanwhile it is to be noted
that while in Great Britain about 25 cases of injury
are reported to each one of death, in America but
four cases are reported to each death&mdash;a discrepancy
which is extremely suggestive. Perhaps, however,
the most valuable conclusion to be drawn from
these figures is that in America we as yet are absolutely
without any reliable railroad statistics on this
subject at all.</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, however, and under the most
favorable showing, it would seem to be a matter of
fair inference that the dangers incident to railroad
traveling are materially greater in the United States
than in any country of Europe. How much greater
is a question wholly impossible to answer. So that
when a statistical writer undertakes to show, as one
eminent European authority has done, that in a
given year on the American roads one passenger in
every 286,179 was killed, and one in every 90,737
was injured, it is charitable to suppose that in regard
to America only is he indebted to his imagination
for his figures.</p>

<p>Neither is it possible to analyze with any satisfactory
degree of precision the nature of the accidents
in the two countries, with a view to drawing inferences
from them. Without attempting to do so it
maybe said that the English Board of Trade reports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
for the last five years, 1874-8, include inquiries
into 755 out of 11,585 accidents, the total number
of every description reported as having taken place.
Meanwhile the <cite>Railroad Gazette</cite> contains mention
of 4,846 reported train accidents which occurred
in America during the same five years. Of these
accidents, 1,310 in America and 81 in Great Britain
were due to causes which were either unexplained
or of a miscellaneous character, or are not common
to the systems of the two countries. In so far as
the remainder admitted of classification, it was
somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The above record, though almost valueless for
any purpose of exact comparison, reveals, it will
be noticed, one salient fact. Out of 755 English
accidents, no less than 406 came under the head of
collisions&mdash;whether head collisions, rear collisions,
or collisions on sidings or at junctions. In other
words, to collisions of some sort between trains
were due considerably more than half (54 per cent.)
of the accidents which took place in Great Britain,
while only 88, or less than 13 per cent. of the whole,
were due to derailments from all causes. In America
on the other hand, while of the 3,763 accidents recorded,
1,324, or but one-third part (35 per cent.)
were due to collisions, no less than 586, or 24 per
cent., were classed under the head of derailments,
due to defects in the permanent way. During the
the six years 1873-8 there were in all 1698 cases of
collision of every description between trains reported
as occurring in America to 1495 in the
United Kingdom; but while in America the derailments
amounted to no less than 4016, or more than
twice the collisions, in the United Kingdom they
were but 817, or a little more than half their number.
It has already been noticed that the most disastrous
accidents in America are apt to occur on
bridges, and Ashtabula and Tariffville at once suggest
themselves. This is not the case in Great
Britain. Under the heading of "Failures of Tunnels,
Bridges, Viaducts or Culverts," there were returned
in that country during the six years 1873-8<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
only 29 accidents in all; while during the same time
in America, under the heads of broken bridges or
tressels and open draws, the <cite>Gazette</cite> recorded no less
than 165. These figures curiously illustrate the different
manner in which the railroads of the two
countries have been constructed, and the different
circumstances under which they are operated. The
English collisions are distinctly traceable to constant
overcrowding; the American derailments and
bridge accidents to inferior construction of our road-beds.</p>

<p>Finally, what of late years has been done to diminish
the dangers of the rail?&mdash;What more can be
done?&mdash;Few persons realize what a tremendous
pressure in this respect is constantly bearing down
upon those whose business it is to operate railroads.
A great accident is not only a terrible blow to the
pride and prestige of a corporation, not only does it
practically ruin the unfortunate officials involved in
it, but it entails also portentous financial consequences.
Juries proverbially have little mercy for
railroad corporations, and, when a disaster comes,
these have practically no choice but to follow the
scriptural injunction to settle with their adversaries
quickly. The Revere catastrophe, for instance, cost
the railroad company liable on account of it over
half a million of dollars; the Ashtabula accident over
$600,000; the Wollaston over $300,000. A few years
ago in England a jury awarded a sum of $65,000 for
damages sustained through the death of a single individual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
During the five years, 1867-71, the railroad
corporations of Great Britain paid out over
$11,000,000 in compensation for damages occasioned
by accidents. In view, merely, of such money consequences
of disaster, it would be most unnatural did
not each new accident lead to the adoption of better
appliances to prevent its recurrence.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>To return, however, to the subject of railroad accidents,
and the final conclusion to be drawn from
the statistics which have been presented. That conclusion
briefly stated is that the charges of recklessness
and indifference so generally and so widely
advanced against those managing the railroads cannot
for an instant be sustained. After all, as was
said in the beginning of the present volume, it
is not the danger but the safety of the railroad
which should excite our special wonder. If any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
one doubts this, it is very easy to satisfy himself
of the fact,&mdash;that is, if by nature he is gifted
with the slightest spark of imagination. It is but
necessary to stand once on the platform of a way-station
and to look at an express train dashing
by. There are few sights finer; few better calculated
to quicken the pulse. It is most striking
at night. The glare of the head-light, the rush
and throb of the locomotive,&mdash;the connecting rod
and driving-wheels of which seem instinct with
nervous life,&mdash;the flashing lamps in the cars, and the
final whirl of dust in which the red tail-lights vanish
almost as soon as they are seen,&mdash;all this is well calculated
to excite our admiration; but the special
and unending cause for wonder is how, in case of
accident, anything whatever is left of the train.
As it plunges into the darkness it would seem to
be inevitable that something must happen, and
that, whatever happens, it must necessarily involve
both the train and every one in it in utter and
irremediable destruction. Here is a body weighing
in the neighborhood of two hundred tons, moving
over the face of the earth at a speed of sixty feet
a second and held to its course only by two slender
lines of iron rails;&mdash;and yet it is safe!&mdash;We have
seen how when, half a century ago, the possibility of
something remotely like this was first discussed, a
writer in the <cite>British Quarterly</cite> earned for himself a
lasting fame by using the expression that "We
should as soon expect people to suffer themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
to be fired off upon one of Congreve's <i>ricochet</i>
rockets, as to trust themselves to the mercy of
such a machine, going at such a rate;"&mdash;while Lord
Brougham exclaimed that "the folly of seven hundred
people going fifteen miles an hour, in six trains,
exceeds belief." At the time they wrote, the
chances were ninety-nine in a hundred that both
reviewer and correspondent were right; and yet,
because reality, not for the first nor the last time, saw
fit to outstrip the wildest flights of imagination, the
former at least blundered, by being prudent, into
an immortality of ridicule. The thing, however, is
still none the less a miracle because it is with us
matter of daily observation. That, indeed, is the
most miraculous part of it. At all hours of the day
and of the night, during every season of the year,
this movement is going on. It never wholly stops.
It depends for its even action on every conceivable
contingency, from the disciplined vigilance of thousands
of employés to the condition of the atmosphere,
the heat of an axle, or the strength of a
nail. The vast machine is in constant motion,
and the derangement of a single one of a myriad
of conditions may at any moment occasion one of
those inequalities of movement which are known
as accidents. Yet at the end of the year, of the
hundreds of millions of passengers fewer have lost
their lives through these accidents than have been
murdered in cold blood. Not without reason,
therefore, has it been asserted that, viewing at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
once the speed, the certainty, and the safety with
which the intricate movement of modern life is
carried on, there is no more creditable monument
to human care, human skill, and human foresight
than the statistics of railroad accidents.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The bell-cord in America, notwithstanding the theoretical objections
which have been urged to its adoption in other countries, has
proved such a simple and perfect protection against dangers from inability
to communicate between portions of trains that accidents from
this cause do not enter into the consideration of American railroad
managers. Yet they do, now and again, occur. For instance, on
February 28, 1874, a passenger coach in a west-bound accommodation
train of the Great Western railroad of Canada took fire from the falling
of a lamp in the closet at its forward end. The bell-cord was
for some reason not connected with the locomotive, and the train
ran two miles before it could be stopped. The coach in question was
entirely destroyed and eight passengers were either burned or suffocated,
while no less than thirteen others sustained injuries in jumping
from the train.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> A collision very similar to that at Camphill occurred upon the
Erie railway at a point about 20 miles west of Port Jervis on the afternoon
of July 15, 1864. The train in this case consisted of eighteen
cars, in which were some 850 Confederate soldiers on their way
under guard to the prisoner's camp at Elmira. A coal train consisting
of 50 loaded cars from the hanch took the main line at Lackawaxen.
The telegraph operator there informed its conductor that the
track was clear, and, while rounding a sharp reversed curve, the two
trains came together, the one going at about twelve and the other at
some twenty miles an hour. Some 60 of the soldiers, besides a
number of train hands were killed on the spot, and 120 more were
seriously injured, some of them fatally.
</p>
<p>
This disaster occurred in the midst of some of the most important
operations of the Rebellion and excited at the time hardly any notice.
There was a suggestive military promptness in the subsequent proceedings.
"T. J. Ridgeway, Esq., Associate Judge of Pike County,
was soon on the spot, and, after consultation with Mr. Riddle [the
superintendent of the Erie road] and the officer in command of the
men, a jury was impanneled and an inquest held; after which a
large trench was dug by the soldiers and the railway employés, 76
feet long, 8 feet wide and 6 feet deep, in which the bodies were at
once interred in boxes, hastily constructed&mdash;one being allotted to
four rebels, and one to each Union soldier." There were sixteen of
the latter killed.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The Angola was probably the most impressively horrible of the
many "stove accidents." That which occurred near Prospect, N. Y.,
upon the Buffalo, Corry &amp; Pittsburgh road, on December 24, 1872,
should not, however, be forgotten. In this case a trestle bridge gave
way precipitating a passenger train some thirty feet to the bottom of a
ravine, where the cars caught fire from the stoves. Nineteen lives
were lost, mostly by burning. The Richmond Switch disaster of
April 19, 1873, on the New York, Providence &amp; Boston road was of
the same character. Three passengers only were there burned to
death, but after the disaster the flames rushed "through the car as
quickly as if the wood had been a lot of hay," and, after those who
were endeavoring to release the wounded and imprisoned men were
driven away, their cries were for some time heard through the smoke
and flame.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Of the same general character with the Tariffville and Ashtabula
accidents were those which occurred on November 1, 1855, upon the
Pacific railroad of Missouri at the bridge over the Gasconade, and
on July 27, 1875, upon the Northern Pacific at the bridge over the
Mississippi near Brainerd. In the first of these accidents the bridge
gave way under an excursion train, in honor of the opening of the
road, and its chief engineer was among the killed. The train fell
some thirty feet, and 22 persons lost their lives while over 50 suffered
serious injuries.
</p>
<p>
At Brainerd the train,&mdash;a "mixed" one,&mdash;went down nearly 80
feet into the river. The locomotive and several cars had passed the
span which fell, in safety, but were pulled back and went down on
top of the train. There were but few passengers in it, of whom three
were killed. In falling the caboose car at the rear of the train, in
which most of the passengers were, struck on a pier and broke in two,
leaving several passengers in it. In the case of the Gasconade, the
disaster was due to the weakness of the bridge, which fell under the
weight of the train. There is some question as to the Brainerd accident,
whether it was occasioned by weakness of the bridge or the
derailment upon it of a freight car.</p></div>

not deemed of sufficient importance to demand special inquiry, 86
cases of accidents of this description were investigated by the inspecting
officers of the English Board of Trade and reported upon
in detail. In America, 732 cases were reported as occurring during
the six years 1874-8, and 138 cases in 1878 alone.</p></div>

in 1869, daily brought into Boston and carried from it, on three hundred
and eighty-five trains, while the South Eastern railway of London
received and despatched in 1870, on an average, six hundred and
fifty trains a day, between 6 <small>A.M.</small> and 12 <small>P.M.</small> carrying from 35,000
to 40,000 persons, and this too without the occurrence of a single
train accident during the year. On one single exceptional day eleven
hundred and eleven trains, carrying 145,000 persons, are said to have
entered and left this station in the space of eighteen hours."&mdash;<cite>Third
Annual Report, [1872] of Massachusetts Railroad Commissioners, p.
141.</cite>
</p>
<p>
The passenger movement over the roads terminating in Boston was
probably as heavy on June 17, 1875, as during any twenty-four hours
in their history. It was returned at 280,000 persons carried in 641
trains. About twice the passenger movement of the "exceptional
day" referred to, carried in something more than half the number of
trains, entering and leaving eight stations instead of one.</p></div>

nearly twice the amount of track room under cover of the Cannon
street station. The daily train movement of the latter would be precisely
paralleled in New York, though not equalled in amount, if
the 42d street station were at Trinity church, and, in addition to
the trains which now enter and leave it, all the city trains of the
Elevated road were also provided for there.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> A sufficiently popular description of this apparatus also, illustrated
by cuts, will be found in Barry's excellent little treatise on <cite>Railway
Appliances</cite>, already referred to, published by Longmans &amp; Co. as one
of their series of text-books of science.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> In regard to the interlocking system as then in use in England,
Captain Tyler in his report as head of the railway inspecting department
of the Board of Trade, used the following language in his report
on the accidents during 1870. "When the apparatus is properly
constructed and efficiently maintained, the signalman cannot make a
mistake in the working of his points and signals which shall lead to
accident or collision, except only by first lowering his signal and
switching his train forward, then putting up his signal again as it approaches,
and altering the points as the driver comes up to, or while
he is passing over them. Such a mistake was actually made in one
of the cases above quoted. It is, of course, impossible to provide completely
for cases of this description; but the locking apparatus, as
now applied, is already of enormous value in preventing accidents;
and it will have a still greater effect on the general safety of railway
travelling as it becomes more extensively applied on the older lines.
Without it, a signalman in constantly working points and signals is
almost certain sooner or later to make a mistake, and to cause an
accident of a more or less serious character; and it is inexcusable in
any railway company to allow its mail or express trains to run at high
speed through facing points which are not interlocked efficiently with
the signals, by which alone the engine-drivers in approaching them
can be guided. There is however, very much yet to be effected in
different parts of the country in this respect. And it is worth while
to record here, in illustration of the difficulties that are sometimes
met with by the inspecting officers, that the Midland Railway Company
formally protested in June, 1866, against being compelled to
apply such apparatus before receiving sanction for the opening of
new lines of railway. They stated that in complying with the requirements
in this respect of the Board of Trade, they '<em>were acting
in direct opposition to their own convictions, and they must,
so far as lay in their power, decline the responsibility of the locking
system</em>.'"
</p>
<p>
To still further perfect the appliance a simple mechanism has since
1870 been attached to the rod actuating the switch-bolt, which prevents
the signal-man from shifting the switch under a passing train
in the manner suggested by Captain Tyler in the above extract. In
fact it is no exaggeration to say that the interlocking system has now
been so studied, and every possible contingency so thoroughly provided

often made by signal men with conflicting signals or with facing
points I have shown the traffic for a single day, and at certain hours
of that day, at the Cannon Street station of the South Eastern Railway,
already referred to as one of the <em>no-accident</em> lines of the year.
The traffic of that station, with trains continually crossing one another,
by daylight and in darkness, in fog or in sunshine, amounts to
more than 130 trains in three hours in the morning, and a similar
number in the evening; and, altogether, to 652 trains, conveying
more than 35,000 passengers in the day as a winter, or 40,000 passengers
a day as a summer average. It is probably not too much to say,
that without the signal and point arrangements which have there been
supplied, and the system of interlocking which has there been so carefully
carried out, the signalmen could not carry on their duties <em>for one
hour without accident</em>." <cite>Captain Tyler's report on accidents for 1870,

one railway by another is a matter of very serious import. Even
when signalled on the most approved principles, they are a source of
danger, and, if possible, should always be avoided. At junctions of
branch or other railways the practice has been adopted by some companies
in special cases, to carry the off line under or over the main
line by a bridge. This course should generally be adopted in the
case of railways on which the traffic is large, and more expressly
where express and fast trains are run." <cite>Report on Accidents on Railways
of the United Kingdom during 1877, p. 35.</cite></p></div>

since 1874, Mr. Thomas E. Harrison, civil engineer of the
North Eastern Railway Company in a communication to the directors
of that company of April 24, 1879, recommending the adoption by it
of the Westinghouse, and subsequently ordered to be printed for
the use of Parliament, thus referred to the triple valve: "As the
most important [of these modifications] I will particularly draw your
attention to the "triple-valve" which has been made a regular bugbear
by the opponents of the system, and has been called complicated,
delicate, and liable to get out of order, etc. * * * It is, in fact,
as simple a piece of mechanism as well can be imagined, certain in
its action, of durable materials, easily accessible to an ordinary workman
for examination or cleaning, and there is nothing about it that
can justify the term complication; on the contrary, it is a model of
ingenuity and simplicity."</p></div>

to some derangement of the apparatus of the Westinghouse brake
were reported by ten companies in runs aggregating about two million
miles. Being one stop to 6,600 miles run. Very many of these
stops were obviously due to the want of familiarity of the employés
with an apparatus new to them, but as a rule the delays occasioned
did not exceed a very few minutes; of 82 stoppages, for instance, reported
on the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast road, the two longest
were ten minutes each and the remainder averaged some three or four
minutes.</p></div>

of any particular brake was brought to bear, out of 473 locomotives
equipped with train-brakes 361 have the Westinghouse, which is also
applied to 1,363 out of 1,669 cars. Of these, however, 79 locomotives
and 358 cars are equipped with both the atmospheric and the vacuum
brakes.</p></div>

force by Mr. William Galt in his report as one of the Royal Commission
of 1874 on Railway Accidents. Mr. Galt's individual report
bears date February 5, 1877, and in it he asserts that, as a matter of
actual experience, the principle of self-interest on the part of the
railway companies has proved a wholly insufficient safeguard against
accidents. However it may be in theory, he contends that, taking
into consideration the great cost of the appliances necessary to insure
safety to the public on the one side, and the amount of damages incident
to a certain degree of risk on the other side, the possible
saving in expenditure to the companies by assuming the risk far exceeds
the loss incurred by an occasional accident. The companies
become, in a word, insurers of their passengers,&mdash;the premium
being found in the economies effected by not adopting improved appliances
of recognized value, and the losses being the damages incurred
in case of accident. He treats the whole subject at great
length and with much knowledge and ability. His report is a most
valuable compendium for those who are in favor of a closer government
supervision over railroads as a means of securing an increased
safety from accident.</p></div>
